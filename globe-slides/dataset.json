,{":@computed_region_cbhk_fwbd":"9",":@computed_region_nnqa_25f4":"1449","adminname1":"Colorado","adminname2":"Garfield","cat_id":"3866","cat_src":"glc","changeset_id":"1","comments":"Several Garfield County roads were so badly damaged during recent torrential rains and floods, the county is having to sidestep its own rules to get them fixed quickly.  County Roads 320 (the Rifle-Rulison Road), 115 (Red Canyon Road) and 100 (Catherine Store Road) in Missouri Heights were closed in late July as a result of mudslides and rockfalls along certain stretches.  Public Works Director Betsy Suerth got permission on Monday from the Garfield Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) to spent an estimated $2 million to fix the roads, and to do so in an â€œexpedited mannerâ€\u009d to get the roads open to the public as quickly as possible.  â€œI believe that the damages have caused unsafe conditions and pose a threat to the safety of the public,â€\u009d Suerth told the BOCC.  County attorney Andrew Gorgey assured the BOCC that state law does allow for such shortcuts in the case of emergencies.  That means the county's normal procurement system, in particular the advertisement for requests for proposals from interested contractors, will be skipped.  In fact, one contract, for $459,548 to fix the Rifle-Rulison Road, was awarded on Monday to the Con-Sy Inc. company of Rifle.  Con-Sy was the low bidder in a list of three firms, which included Frontier Paving and Aspen Earth Moving.  Commissioner Mike Samson, agreeing with the other two commissioners that â€œwe definitely have to do something,â€\u009d balked at spending $2 million so quickly.  â€œIs there another approach to this?â€\u009d he asked.  Although the contract for one road already has been awarded, Garfield County procurement officer Jim Hackett said it will be another 10 days before the same could be done for the other two roads.  In the meantime, Commissioner John Martin suggested that the need to fix Red Canyon Road, in particular, should be examined.  â€œThat has been deemed an argument since the creation of 115 Road itself,â€\u009d he remarked. â€œDoes it really need to be open, because it's such a dangerous road.â€\u009d  Garfield County officials have debated the subject for years, bickering about the narrow road enclosed by steep canyon walls that, on one side, form a sheer drop to the floor far below. In winter, the steep canyon walls allows in little sun to melt accumulated snow and ice, making the road even more treacherous.  County Manager Ed Green said the county could look at rebuilding Red Canyon Road to make it safer, a project he predicted could cost as much a $28 million.

County Roads 320 (the Rifle-Rulison Road), 115 (Red Canyon Road) and 100 (Catherine Store Road) in Missouri Heights were closed in late July as a result of mudslides and rockfalls along certain stretches.  Public Works Director Betsy Suerth got permission on Monday from the Garfield Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) to spent an estimated $2 million to fix the roads, and to do so in an â€œexpedited mannerâ€\u009d to get the roads open to the public as quickly as possible.  â€œI believe that the damages have caused unsafe conditions and pose a threat to the safety of the public,â€\u009d Suerth told the BOCC.  County attorney Andrew Gorgey assured the BOCC that state law does allow for such shortcuts in the case of emergencies.  That means the county's normal procurement system, in particular the advertisement for requests for proposals from interested contractors, will be skipped.  In fact, one contract, for $459,548 to fix the Rifle-Rulison Road, was awarded on Monday to the Con-Sy Inc. company of Rifle.  Con-Sy was the low bidder in a list of three firms, which included Frontier Paving and Aspen Earth Moving.  Commissioner Mike Samson, agreeing with the other two commissioners that â€œwe definitely have to do something,â€\u009d balked at spending $2 million so quickly.  â€œIs there another approach to this?â€\u009d he asked.  Although the contract for one road already has been awarded, Garfield County procurement officer Jim Hackett said it will be another 10 days before the same could be done for the other two roads.  In the meantime, Commissioner John Martin suggested that the need to fix Red Canyon Road, in particular, should be examined.  â€œThat has been deemed an argument since the creation of 115 Road itself,â€\u009d he remarked. â€œDoes it really need to be open, because it's such a dangerous road.â€\u009d  Garfield County officials have debated the subject for years, bickering about the narrow road enclosed by steep canyon walls that, on one side, form a sheer drop to the floor far below. In winter, the steep canyon walls allows in little sun to melt accumulated snow and ice, making the road even more treacherous.  County Manager Ed Green said the county could look at rebuilding Red Canyon Road to make it safer, a project he predicted could cost as much a $28 million.  No decisions were made other than a unanimous vote to award the Rifle-Rulison Road project to Con-Sy, for $459,548. With other costs not included in the contract, the project is to cost up to $650,000.  jcolson@postindependent.com ","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2011-07-30T00:00:00.000","distance":"4.9095399999999998","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.1291,39.4274]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"3865","key":"h5ToDJFB4","landslide_size":"Small","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"39.427399999999999","location_accuracy":"Known_within_10_km","longitude":"-107.12909999999999","near":"El Jebel","nearest_places":"Catherine Store Road, Garfield County, CO","population":"3801","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

The Gomez Muldonado family had noticed the river behind their house in Mexico swelling, and tried to take precautions. They packed their car with essentials so they could get away quickly. They slept at the nearby coffee plantation at night rather than their house. But in the end, it didn't matter. At about 3 p.m. Sept. 16, days of rain from Tropical Storm Manuel caused a mudslide that buried half of the small, coffee-growing town of La Pintada. Although the tragedy occurred more than 2,000 miles away, its heartbreak and loss have overwhelmed families in Bluffton. Irma Gomez, who moved from La Pintada 13 years ago, lost 20 relatives in the mudslide. Among them were her mother, father and two brothers. \"It is very sad and devastating because they lost everything and we lost everything,\" Gomez, 31, said through a translator. \"We don't know if we ever are going to be able to go back there.\" Gomez's family is not the only one struck by the disaster. The assistant principal at Red Cedar Elementary School, where one of Gomez's children is enrolled, said at least three local families were directly affected. But the number of people touched indirectly is much higher, she said. Gomez first learned of the disaster on Facebook since no communication was coming from the town. She didn't want to believe it was true at first, she said. But after talking to her brother, Jose Antonio, who was not in the house at the time and survived, reality started to set in. \"We try to find peace, but we can't,\" Gomez said of several of her brothers and sisters who also live in the Bluffton area. \"We still hold on to the hope that somebody is still alive, but every day that passes takes away that hope.\" As soon as she learned of the mudslide, Gomez called every aid organization she could think of to tell them there were people who needed help and ask what was being done. She said she kept getting the same answer: \"We're working on it.\" But later Gomez heard from her brother and other survivors that the help never came. She said she kept hearing: \"We're hungry; we're cold; we have injured people, and we don't have any help.\" Three days had gone by and still there was no relief for La Pintada, a town of 800 in the southwest Guerrero state of Mexico. The dead number more than 100, and more than 60 people are declared missing. \"There was nothing, no help,\" Gomez said. \"Nada, nada.\" Finally, on the fourth day, some help arrived. But not for long, she said. Only eight bodies were recovered before the authorities departed again, Gomez said. \"I cannot sleep at night because we feel powerless, because we cannot go there and can't do anything from here,\" Gomez said. \"We would like to go and dig with our own hands.\" Red Cedar Elementary School is trying to help the families and the town. Starting this week the school's Kindness Club will collect coins and donations from students and the community, assistant principal Melissa Vogt said. \"Even though it is many thousands of miles away, people are directly and indirectly affected right here in our community,\" Vogt said. \"So the school is trying to provide that stable environment while supporting our families.\" Vogt said collections will begin Tuesday or Wednesday and will last a week. The school then will send what it gathers to the Red Cross in Mexico, she said. Residents who wish to donate to the cause should email Audrey Kaney, adviser for the Kindness Club at Red Cedar Elementary ataudrey.kaney@beaufort.k12.sc.us.

,{"adminname1":"Veracruz-Llave","cat_id":"5532","cat_src":"glc","changeset_id":"1","comments":"The remnants of Hurricane Ingrid and Tropical Storm Manuel drenched northeastern and southwestern Mexico with torrential rains Monday, flooding towns and cities, cutting highways and setting off landslides in a national emergency that federal authorities said had caused at least 34 deaths. The Mexican government said the country had not seen a similar weather crisis since 1958, when the country was simultaneously hit by two tropical storms, also on separate coasts. The governor of the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz announced that 12 people died when a landslide smashed into a bus traveling through the town of Altotonga, about 40 miles northwest of the state capital. More than 23,000 people fled their homes in the state due to heavy rains spawned by Ingrid, and 9,000 went to emergency shelters. At least 20 highways and 12 bridges had been damaged, the state's civil protection authority said. Some of the heaviest damage was in the southern coastal state of Guerrero, where Mexico's government reported 15 confirmed deaths from Manuel. State officials said people had been killed in landslides, drownings in a swollen river and a truck crash on a rain-slickened mountain highway. Flooding closed the main highway from Mexico City to Acapulco, and power cuts shut the resort city's main airport, isolating many tourists over a long holiday weekend. Telephone service was cut around the state, though authorities said it was mostly restored by Monday afternoon. Mexico's federal Civil Protection coordinator, Luis Felipe Puente, told reporters late Sunday that stormy weather from one or both of the two systems also caused three deaths in Hidalgo, three in Puebla and one in Oaxaca. Manuel came ashore as a tropical storm Sunday afternoon near the Pacific port of Manzanillo, but quickly lost strength and was downgraded to a tropical depression late Sunday. It dissipated into an unorganized rain system Monday. Manuel dumped heavy rains over much of the states of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, Jalisco and Nayarit, presenting a dangerous threat in mountains where flash floods and mudslides were possible. Late Monday, Ingrid had moved inland over northeastern Mexico and was a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (45 kph). It was centered about 10 miles (15 kilometers) west of the Ciudad Vitoria, capital of Tamaulipas and was moving west at 5 mph (7 kph). Forecasters predicted the storm would dissipate Tuesday.","continentcode":"NA","country":"Mexico","countrycode":"MX","countryname":"Mexico","date":"2013-09-16T00:00:00.000","distance":"0.50187999999999999","fatalities":"12","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.2422,19.7615]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5532","injuries":"8","key":"sJF1N9dQ7","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"19.761500000000002","location_accuracy":"Known_within_1_km","longitude":"-97.242199999999997","near":"Altotonga","nearest_places":"Xaltepec, Altotonga, Ver","population":"15800","source_link":"http://www.startribune.com/223894771.html","source_name":"www.startribune.com","storm_name":"Ingrid","time":"8:00:00","trigger":"Tropical_Cyclone","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

The girl, Gracie Johnson, was in stable condition after surgery to repair a broken leg. SheriffÃ•s deputies and some 40 volunteers from various agencies have recovered the five bodies at the base of the Agnes Vaille Falls, Chaffee County Sheriff Pete Palmer said just before 2 p.m. A spokeswoman for Chaffee County identified the dead as Dwayne and Dawna Johnson, 46 and 45, their daughter Kiowa-Rain, 18, and two visiting nephews, Baigen Walker, 10, and Paris Walkup, 22. Dawna Johnson was a high school track coach, authorities said. Rescuers dug Gracie out after the rockslide Monday. Chaffee County SheriffÃ•s Deputy Nick Tolsma said he saw GracieÃ•s hand sticking out from the boulders and helped pull her free. The girl told him that her father had protected her from the rocks, he said. Ã’Her dad is a real hero,Ã“ the deputyÃŠtold TODAY. Ã’Saved her life.Ã“ The five were hiking a popular trail below 14,000-foot Mount Princeton when several bounders came loose in a rockslide several football fields across.

Ã’There was a cliff bank above the falls, and it looks like it slid off,Ã“ he told TODAY.

Ã’Like a whole chunk of the mountain just slid down,Ã“ he told the dispatcher. Dawna Johnson was a track coach at Buena Vista High School, authorities said.

The storm also caused minor flooding along U.S. Highway 50 west of Canon City. Steve Hodanish of the National Weather Service in Pueblo says a tornado was spotted near Hanover and touched ground for at least five minutes. The slow speed of the storms, not necessarily the intensity, caused problems. Some storms were moving as slow as 10 mph or were even stationary, which meant large amounts of rain dropped on the same area and increased the chance of flooding.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2014-07-12T00:00:00.000","distance":"3.6099800000000002","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.8618,38.8416]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"6137","injuries":"0","key":"DJJaDwiU_xauS","landslide_size":"Small","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"38.8416","location_accuracy":"Known_within_5_km","location_description":"Above_road","longitude":"-104.8618","near":"Colorado Springs","nearest_places":"Colorado Springs, Colorado","population":"416427","source_link":"http://www.dailyjournal.net/view/story/0dd2bd763fd64f33a261d0da8508d41f/CO--Colorado-Flooding/#.U8aT__ldU1I","source_name":"Daily Journal","time":"afternoon","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Sun Aug 24 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

So far no one has been hurt and no buildings destroyed, but many who live in the canyon are on edge. Driving down the switchbacks through Oak Creek Canyon, visitors may not initially notice signs of a 21,227-acre fire. Thatâ€™s until you see the yellow tape and barricades blocking the picnic areas and hiking trails. Catch a glimpse of the creek and youâ€™ll see itâ€™s flowing the color of coffee. The recent rains have pushed ash down the steep slopes into the popular waterway. Sedona Fire Chief Kris Kazian said Sundayâ€™s short rain shower caused large rocks to come loose as well.  â€œThereâ€™s very much an unpredictable and dynamic situation,â€\u009d Kazian said. â€œSo depending on the rain we get, if itâ€™s a one-inch rain that passes over a fast period of time a short period of time if it sits up at the top isolated over one area. All those things can create different problems. One of the sheriffs said, â€˜weâ€™re kind of playing in a game that we donâ€™t know the rules and we might not even even be sure which game weâ€™re playing.â€™â€\u009d  Gary Garland and his staff have dug channels in the hopes of draining any potential mudslide away from the property. Fifty homes and businesses sit in the potential pathway of mudslides.

The incident occurred on Wednesday 2 July 2013, blocking the entrance to the small gold mine where the men were working and trapping them inside. Local firefighters have made contact with three of the men, and are supplying them with oxygen via a hosepipe while rocks and debris are cleared from the mine entrance by hand to avoid causing any further ground movements. The fate of the remaining miners is unclear, and it is understood that the mine reaches 80 m beneath the surface. It is unclear whether the landslide was triggered by the activities of the miners, or whether it was caused by rainfall. Landslides are a common problem after severe weather events, as excess pore water pressure overcomes the sediments cohesion and allows it to flow downhill. Approximately 90% of all landslides are caused by heavy rainfall. July falls in the middle of the rainy season in southern Honduras, and the area typically receives about 150 mm of rain during the month, though there have been no other reports of landslides or flash-floods in the area this week.","continentcode":"NA","country":"Honduras","countrycode":"HN","countryname":"Honduras","date":"2014-07-02T00:00:00.000","distance":"3.6959599999999999","fatalities":"8","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.0325,13.2875]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"6123","injuries":"3","key":"h9OmfDjaLs","landslide_size":"Small","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"13.2875","location_accuracy":"Known_within_25_km","location_description":"Mine_construction","longitude":"-87.032499999999999","near":"Ciudad Choluteca","nearest_places":"San Juan de Arriba,  El Corpus, Choluteca","photos_link":"http://noticias.emisorasunidas.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/350x250/2014/07/03/bomberos_hondurenos_siguen_labores_de_rescate_de_mineros_atrapados_foto_la_prensa_de_honduras.jpg,http://cdn.latribuna.hn/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PORTADA-MINAS.jpg","population":"75872","source_link":"http://sciencythoughts.blogspot.com/2014/07/miners-trapped-by-honduran-landslide.html","source_name":"Sciency Thoughts","time":"16:30","trigger":"Mining_digging","tstamp":"Mon Jan 26 2015 23:42:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"2"}

It's from man-made problems from the Oak Hall Regional Park.\" \"It appears the retaining pond got filled up and overflowed,\" says Bill Smith, Darlene's family member who came by to check out the damage to the house and the area.  \"It basically pushed all the water right down the hill instead of putting it on the other side of the road and making it go down to the streams.\" Officials came to assess the damage Wednesday afternoon.  They say they're surprised this happened. \"We feel terrible about what happened to the neighbors and the runoff that went onto their land,\" says Jim Steff, the Executive Director of Centre Region Council of Governance.   Steff says he's bringing engineers out as soon as possible to figure out how to correct the issue so this doesn't happen again.

The government's National Emergency Management Organization said one of those who died was an 18-year-old college student. Five people were reported missing. Among the eight killed was a cousin of Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves, Cassian Gonsalves, who died Tuesday night when a landslide crashed through his house, Cassian cousin Mark Boyea told The Associated Press. The devastation prompted the prime minister to cut short a family vacation that had taken him to England and Rome, and he was due to return home Thursday. Photos posted by the Vatican showed that Gonsalves had met with Pope Francis. In the heavily hit area of North Leeward in northwestern St. Vincent, a family of five was killed when a house was swept into their home. Sixty-two people had taken refuge at a school converted to a shelter. The emergency office said nine houses had been destroyed and 15 others were damaged. Several communities remained isolated because of damaged bridges or blocked roads, it said. There was extensive flooding and damage elsewhere in the eastern part of the Caribbean. Police on the nearby island of St. Lucia said a man died there when a wall fell on him. Traditional Christmas Eve midnight religious services were cancelled and several churches in the capital of Castries opened their doors to stranded people. \"It's the worst Christmas I will ever spend,\" said Jude Francis, his clothes soaked from the rain. St. Lucia Prime Minister Kenny Anthony described the damage as an emergency and a major setback for the country. \"I don't think I can recall when we have had such heavy rainfall on the eve of Christmas,\" he said. On the nearby island of Dominica, dozens of homes and at least two hotels were evacuated because of the danger of landslides and several roads were blocked by mud. The cluster of thunderstorms came as the small islands were crowded with holiday tourists. Showers were expected to linger over the British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic throughout Wednesday.","continentcode":"NA","country":"St Lucia","countrycode":"LC","countryname":"Saint Lucia","date":"2013-12-24T00:00:00.000","distance":"3.8146900000000001","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-60.9268,13.8891]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5718","key":"hG7hAPFc7","landslide_size":"Large","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"13.889099999999999","location_accuracy":"Known_within_15_km","longitude":"-60.9268","near":"Praslin","nearest_places":"Dennery","population":"1906","source_name":"reliefweb.int","time":"night","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

The road between Franklin Avenue and Fourth Street likely will remain closed for a few days until the debris can be cleared, White said. â€œThereâ€™s no passage through there on foot or bike or car,â€\u009d he said.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2014-06-19T00:00:00.000","distance":"2.5033599999999998","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.2365,44.9683]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"6076","injuries":"0","key":"DGNv1GAfI6","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"44.968299999999999","location_accuracy":"Known_within_1km","location_description":"Above_road","longitude":"-93.236500000000007","near":"Minneapolis","nearest_places":"University of Minnesota Medical Center","photos_link":"http://kstp.com/kstpImages/repository/2015-03/MinneapolisMudslide.jpg,http://bringmethenews.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/fairview-mudslide.jpg,http://kstp.com/kstpImages/repositoryThumbs/2015-01/Permanent_Fix_on_Horizon_for_Mpls_Bluff_Hit_by_June_Mudslide-syndImport-091715.jpg","population":"382578","source_link":"http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/263922941.html","source_name":"Star Tribune","time":"19:00:00","trigger":"Continuous_rain","tstamp":"Fri May 22 2015 19:26:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"2"}

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months. The mudslides washed thousands Ã‘ and possibly millions Ã‘ of yards of mud, rock and debris off the upper slopes and down into the canyon, and much of it entered the river. According to biologists and scientists, the river should be able to clean and restore itself, but that depends on whether more slides occur and whether thereÃ•s enough river flows to clean out the channel. Terry Hardy, soil scientist for the Boise National Forest, said several things are currently in play. The slides that already occurred are more than likely a one-shot deal. They arenÃ•t going to move on that scale again, but could become Ã’chronic bleedersÃ•Ã• of sediment into the river after future rain storms and snowmelt. Slides at Rough Creek and above Reclamation Village spread into broad deltas that could be contoured with earth-moving equipment and replanted to reduce further erosion. Steeper creek drainages, such as Pierce and Granite creeks, could continue to spew mud until they stabilize. Other drainages could still slide, especially with so many slopes laid bare by intense fires. The half inch of rain that fell Sept. 12 was not unusual Ã‘ but it fell in about 45 minutes, which is a brief period for that much rain. Hardy said the burned and bare slopes magnify the effects of storms. For example, a 10-year weather event could have the effects of a 15- or 20-year event, he said. ItÃ•s difficult to know how much rain or snowmelt it will take to trigger more slides. Ã’ThereÃ•s a high level of concern, primarily because weÃ•ve seen what can happen,Ã•Ã• Hardy said. But itÃ•s possible we could have already seen the worst, he said. Ã’I donÃ•t know if there are that many more tributaries that could release and have that kind of an effect,Ã•Ã• he said.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-09-12T00:00:00.000","distance":"32.715699999999998","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.6043,43.4205]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5516","key":"D93F5GFKU","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"43.420499999999997","location_accuracy":"Known_within_25_km","longitude":"-115.60429999999999","near":"Mountain Home","nearest_places":"South Fork Canyonâ€Ž, Boise National Forest, Idaho","population":"14206","source_link":"http://magicvalley.com/news/local/fire-mudslide-transform-south-fork-of-boise-river/article_50a2c0b0-313f-11e3-af0a-001a4bcf887a.html","source_name":"magicvalley.com","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

This week, the city continued to approve extra expenses as crews finish building the new and bigger sewer system near Burr Ridge on Purgatory Creek that was overwhelmed during the May and June rains. â€œIt was one of, if not the biggest, rainfall, and unfortunately we were working on a big project,â€\u009d said Robert Ellis, the cityâ€™s public works director. In May, heavy rainfall overflowed the neighborhoodâ€™s 37-year-old sewer system, eroding land between two homes on the ridge. The city hired crews to replace the system with a larger pipe, and they were almost done when more heavy rain June 1 washed away much of the work. â€œIf we had another week or two, we would have been able to complete it,â€\u009d Ellis said. Instead, heavy rains caused a mudslide, opening up an 80-foot ravine in back yards as land gave way and slid down the Purgatory Creek valley. That sent the porch and deck of David Zurnâ€™s home teetering over the huge hole. The city made an emergency decision to demolish his house and is now in the process of buying his property to stabilize the slope and build the bigger sewer system, which will have a channel handling four to 10 times more stormwater than the old system, Ellis said. â€œIt provides a level of protection that neighborhood has never had,â€\u009d he added. But it comes with a cost. What was initially expected to cost no more than $500,000 instead will double to about $1 million to fix the area, build the larger sewer system and pay $99,000 to repair erosion to Zurnâ€™s neighborsâ€™ yard.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2014-06-01T00:00:00.000","distance":"0.15271000000000001","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.4707,44.8533]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"6046","injuries":"0","key":"S5Sxz6VYgS","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"44.853299999999997","location_accuracy":"Known_within_5_km","location_description":"Mine_construction","longitude":"-93.470699999999994","near":"Eden Prairie","nearest_places":"Eden Prairie, Minnesota","population":"60797","source_link":"http://www.startribune.com/local/west/267435731.html","source_name":"Star Tribune","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Wed Sep 10 2014 20:48:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"2"}

The damage overnight Saturday was caused when the wall of dirt pushed the vehicles into each other, with four vehicles totaled, said David Palladino, who lives at 3525 Apulia Road in Jamesville. The auto-repair business, Tri-County Auto Repair Inc., is about 200 yards down the road. Several other cars were damaged, and a few others were wedged in by thick mud. A lawn tractor was completely buried except for the top and the mud pushed alongside the garage, causing a crack in the wall, Palladino said.

The slide occurred around 9:30 p.m. in the northeast section of the mine, Kennecott spokesman Kyle Bennett said. No employees were injured in the slide and its size was not immediately unknown, though it is estimated to be about 2,000-feet wide and 2,000-feet long. \"As of 1 p.m. (Thursday), we are continuing to assess the situation,\" Bennett said. \"We have not been able to determine the magnitude of the slide at this time, but we do know that it is significant.\" The copper-mining company was aware of the impending slide and had warned residents near the mine Wednesday that a slide was possible any day. Kennecott engineers had been detecting ground movement as far back as February. At the time, the movement amounted to just fractions of an inch, but it was enough for the company to close and relocate the mine's visitors center. Engineers at the Bingham Canyon mine spent their time Thursday using sophisticated technology to monitor the area of a giant landside that broke free Wednesday night. But with the help of KSL's Chopper 5, they now have more specific information that will help them determine their next move. Ted Himebaugh has worked at the Bingham Canyon mine for the past 36 years; he's been the mine's general manager of operational readiness for the past decade. He's also part of a team that has focused on an impending landslide problem since the earth started to move in February. \"It's the largest slide we've ever had at the Bingham Canyon mine; and I don't know if it's the largest slide in Utah, but it's a big slide,\" Himebaugh said. Analyzing KSL's Chopper 5 video Thursday helped him to better understand what happened. \"Where it ended at the bottom, it went a little bit further into the bottom than we planned on,\" Himebaugh said, pointing to the video screen. \"We were not expecting that it would cover that much area in the bottom.\" In fact, two-thirds of the bottom of the pit is now covered. The video also helped Himebaugh spot some of the mine's equipment, including nine partially buried trucks, each of them the size of a small home. But his crew's main objective now is to determine the impact of the damage in the bottom of the pit. \"We didn't know from our modeling that all that material would flow to the bottom,\" Himebaugh said. For now, he says the movement of that slide has stopped, but it's too early for his team to determine how soon they can get into that area to assess the damage. \"This is something that we had anticipated,\" Bennett said of the slide. \"We knew the slide was imminent. We had relocated machinery, we had rerouted roads, we had rerouted utilities, we had rerouted buildings.\" Over the past few days, engineers started seeing movement of up to 2 inches per day. \"We've seen acceleration rates increase until where we landed (Wednesday night),\" Bennett said. \"When it reaches 2 inches per day, that's certainly a time when we want to take steps that we have been planning for a number of weeks in order to make sure people are out of the way.\" All employees were evacuated in preemptive measures and were safe and accounted for after the slide. Bennett said access to the mine continued to be restricted Thursday and that no employees were being allowed to enter. \"Our job is to safely produce copper.

The Cincinnati Enquirer reports Sunday that the Ohio Emergency Management Agency estimates the county has $7.4 million in damage. Statewide, the estimate is at $43 million.  The damage comes in the wake of 24.78 inches of rain that fell on Cincinnati during the meteorological spring months of March, April and May, a National Weather Service record in data going back to 1871.  County Engineer William Brayshaw has asked commissioners to fund temporary road fixes nearly every week, up from no such requests the past two years.  The county, along with neighboring Clermont County, have joined 19 Ohio counties to ask for Federal Emergency Management Agency declaration as a major disaster, a move that would allow the counties to receive federal aid for repairs.  In the Cincinnati region, including northern Kentucky, 41.04 inches of rain have fallen since the start of the year, twice the amount that had fallen over the same time period in 2010 and slightly more than the average 12-month rainfall, according to the National Weather Service.  â€œItâ€™s possible weâ€™ll exceed the all-time wettest year on record,â€\u009d said Don Hughes, a meteorologist technician with the National Weather Service in Wilmington.  Part of an infrastructure tax, prompted by a 1986-87 business study, nets about $700,000 a year in Cincinnati and has helped fund a program that works to stabilize against landslides, The Enquirer reports.  Since the program started, the city has stabilized more than 60 locations, said Rich Pohana, Cincinnatiâ€™s geotechnical engineer.  â€œIf those slides were not stabilized this would have been much more dramatic,â€\u009d he said.  Officials said heavy rain in 1996 also brought significant damage to the area. Road damage and landslides cost Hamilton County taxpayers $2.3 million that year, according to the Hamilton County engineerâ€™s office.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2011-07-03T00:00:00.000","distance":"1.9121699999999999","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.1857,39.0928]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"3720","key":"SGGBNsFQW","landslide_size":"Large","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"39.092799999999997","location_accuracy":"Known_within_10_km","longitude":"-84.185699999999997","near":"Batavia","nearest_places":"Clermont County, OH","population":"1509","source_link":"http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/briefs/x1766047308/Cincinnati-wet-weather-means-costly-road-damage","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months. The mudslides washed thousands Ã‘ and possibly millions Ã‘ of yards of mud, rock and debris off the upper slopes and down into the canyon, and much of it entered the river. According to biologists and scientists, the river should be able to clean and restore itself, but that depends on whether more slides occur and whether thereÃ•s enough river flows to clean out the channel. Terry Hardy, soil scientist for the Boise National Forest, said several things are currently in play. The slides that already occurred are more than likely a one-shot deal. They arenÃ•t going to move on that scale again, but could become Ã’chronic bleedersÃ•Ã• of sediment into the river after future rain storms and snowmelt. Slides at Rough Creek and above Reclamation Village spread into broad deltas that could be contoured with earth-moving equipment and replanted to reduce further erosion. Steeper creek drainages, such as Pierce and Granite creeks, could continue to spew mud until they stabilize. Other drainages could still slide, especially with so many slopes laid bare by intense fires. The half inch of rain that fell Sept. 12 was not unusual Ã‘ but it fell in about 45 minutes, which is a brief period for that much rain. Hardy said the burned and bare slopes magnify the effects of storms. For example, a 10-year weather event could have the effects of a 15- or 20-year event, he said. ItÃ•s difficult to know how much rain or snowmelt it will take to trigger more slides. Ã’ThereÃ•s a high level of concern, primarily because weÃ•ve seen what can happen,Ã•Ã• Hardy said. But itÃ•s possible we could have already seen the worst, he said. Ã’I donÃ•t know if there are that many more tributaries that could release and have that kind of an effect,Ã•Ã• he said.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-09-12T00:00:00.000","distance":"30.719069999999999","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.5441,43.3877]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5513","key":"hJQB59mQ4","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"43.387700000000002","location_accuracy":"Known_within_1_km","longitude":"-115.5441","near":"Mountain Home","nearest_places":"Granite Creekâ€Ž, Boise National Forest, Idaho","population":"14206","source_link":"http://magicvalley.com/news/local/fire-mudslide-transform-south-fork-of-boise-river/article_50a2c0b0-313f-11e3-af0a-001a4bcf887a.html","source_name":"magicvalley.com","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

No one was injured in the mudslide early Saturday, but a cement truck was left stuck on the road. Federal officials are looking at ways to fix the road, which buckled and sank more than 30 meters (nearly 100 feet) in the mudslide. Several million dollars will have to be spent to reopen the highway as soon as possible, Communications and Transportation Secretariat deputy director of public works Efrain Arias said. Arias, however, did not provide a timetable for the road's repairs and reopening. Officials have been \"working on alternate routes and they are functioning perfectly well,\" Arias said. The repair project could take up to a year to complete, Ensenada Mayor Gilberto Hirata said. Federal officials are responsible for what happened because they ignored previous buckling of the road and a recommendation from geologists at the Advanced Scientific Research and Education Center in Ensenada to close the highway, Hirata said. Officials overseeing the repair project will consult the center's personnel, who are familiar with soil conditions in the area, where a number of geological faults are present, the mayor said.

The government's National Emergency Management Organization said one of those who died was an 18-year-old college student. Five people were reported missing. Among the eight killed was a cousin of Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves, Cassian Gonsalves, who died Tuesday night when a landslide crashed through his house, Cassian cousin Mark Boyea told The Associated Press. The devastation prompted the prime minister to cut short a family vacation that had taken him to England and Rome, and he was due to return home Thursday. Photos posted by the Vatican showed that Gonsalves had met with Pope Francis. In the heavily hit area of North Leeward in northwestern St. Vincent, a family of five was killed when a house was swept into their home. Sixty-two people had taken refuge at a school converted to a shelter. The emergency office said nine houses had been destroyed and 15 others were damaged. Several communities remained isolated because of damaged bridges or blocked roads, it said. There was extensive flooding and damage elsewhere in the eastern part of the Caribbean. Police on the nearby island of St. Lucia said a man died there when a wall fell on him. Traditional Christmas Eve midnight religious services were cancelled and several churches in the capital of Castries opened their doors to stranded people. \"It's the worst Christmas I will ever spend,\" said Jude Francis, his clothes soaked from the rain. St. Lucia Prime Minister Kenny Anthony described the damage as an emergency and a major setback for the country. \"I don't think I can recall when we have had such heavy rainfall on the eve of Christmas,\" he said. On the nearby island of Dominica, dozens of homes and at least two hotels were evacuated because of the danger of landslides and several roads were blocked by mud. The cluster of thunderstorms came as the small islands were crowded with holiday tourists. Showers were expected to linger over the British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic throughout Wednesday.","continentcode":"NA","country":"St Vincent And The Grenadines","countrycode":"VC","countryname":"Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","date":"2013-12-24T00:00:00.000","distance":"8.6397399999999998","fatalities":"5","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-61.1912,13.3382]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5719","key":"h953WPgQ7","landslide_size":"Very_large","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"13.338200000000001","location_accuracy":"Known_within_25_km","longitude":"-61.191200000000002","near":"Georgetown","nearest_places":"North Leeward","population":"1680","source_link":"http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/3434c873f0cd4e419db103103b3c9222/CB-Caribbean-Heavy-Rains","source_name":"www.therepublic.com","time":"night","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

The Cincinnati Enquirer reports Sunday that the Ohio Emergency Management Agency estimates the county has $7.4 million in damage. Statewide, the estimate is at $43 million.  The damage comes in the wake of 24.78 inches of rain that fell on Cincinnati during the meteorological spring months of March, April and May, a National Weather Service record in data going back to 1871.  County Engineer William Brayshaw has asked commissioners to fund temporary road fixes nearly every week, up from no such requests the past two years.  The county, along with neighboring Clermont County, have joined 19 Ohio counties to ask for Federal Emergency Management Agency declaration as a major disaster, a move that would allow the counties to receive federal aid for repairs.  In the Cincinnati region, including northern Kentucky, 41.04 inches of rain have fallen since the start of the year, twice the amount that had fallen over the same time period in 2010 and slightly more than the average 12-month rainfall, according to the National Weather Service.  â€œItâ€™s possible weâ€™ll exceed the all-time wettest year on record,â€\u009d said Don Hughes, a meteorologist technician with the National Weather Service in Wilmington.  Part of an infrastructure tax, prompted by a 1986-87 business study, nets about $700,000 a year in Cincinnati and has helped fund a program that works to stabilize against landslides, The Enquirer reports.  Since the program started, the city has stabilized more than 60 locations, said Rich Pohana, Cincinnatiâ€™s geotechnical engineer.  â€œIf those slides were not stabilized this would have been much more dramatic,â€\u009d he said.  Officials said heavy rain in 1996 also brought significant damage to the area. Road damage and landslides cost Hamilton County taxpayers $2.3 million that year, according to the Hamilton County engineerâ€™s office.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2011-07-03T00:00:00.000","distance":"1.90865","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.512,39.1031]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"3721","key":"D5JJMDdBU","landslide_size":"Large","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"39.103099999999998","location_accuracy":"Known_within_10_km","longitude":"-84.512","near":"Newport","nearest_places":"Hamilton County, Cincinnati region, OH","population":"15273","source_link":"http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/briefs/x1766047308/Cincinnati-wet-weather-means-costly-road-damage","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

This was stated yesterday by Sangre Grande/Toco Regional Corporation chairman Terry Rondon. The situation had not been resolved up to late yesterday evening, Rondon said, adding that the mudslide was over a month in the making and was now beyond the capabilities of the corporation. Up to late yesterday, dozens were unable to get to their homes in Matelot as the road remained impassable, he said. Rondon said even more people were stranded in the village and were vulnerable in the event of an emergency. Ã’If a pregnant woman needs to get to a hospital tonight, it is impossible,Ã“ Rondon said in a telephone interview. Ã’If an ambulance needs to get in, or someone is bitten by a snake, as it is possible during the rainy season when the reptiles come out, then we have a disaster on our hands. The road is impassable, a few inches away in some areas is the sea. We may not be able to evacuate someone by sea if there is an emergency because the water is very rough during this period,Ã“ he said. An angry Rondon, who grew up in Matelot, said the corporation had reported the potential mudslide to the Ministry of Works several times since the rainy season intensified about a month ago. While waiting for assistance from the ministry, the corporation did what it could to contain the sliding mounds of earth, Rondon said. Ã’It is beyond our capabilities and funding,Ã“ Rondon added. Ã’At one point, the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management (ODPM) paid a visit and declared the scene a disaster. We had hoped this would force the ministry to act but no one did the work that should have been done to prevent this. It is clear that no one cares about the people here.Ã“ Rondon said with a Ministry of Works office in Sangre Grande and a sub-office in Toco, he sees little room for excuses.","continentcode":"NA","country":"Trinidad And Tobago","countrycode":"TT","countryname":"Trinidad and Tobago","date":"2013-12-11T00:00:00.000","distance":"26.688220000000001","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-61.0955,10.8237]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5690","key":"sJopUtmcW","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"10.823700000000001","location_accuracy":"Known_within_10_km","longitude":"-61.095500000000001","near":"Sangre Grande","nearest_places":"Matelot, Sangre Grande, Trinidad And Tobago","population":"15968","source_link":"http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Matelot-mudslide-leaves-dozens-stranded-235510581.html","source_name":"www.trinidadexpress.com","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

Factor in all the recent rain and flooding with a slipping hill, and then a water main break, and it all adds up to a road that's too dangerous for drivers. \"It's dangerous,\" Deb Taylor said. \"I just want it fixed.\" It's safe to say Deb Taylor is a bit frustrated. Instead of a quick trip to the doctor, she and her family are now forced to find another route around Little Coal River Road. It's a detour that Taylor says could easily more than double her drive. \"I can be at work in 20 minutes,\" Taylor said. \"Now it's probably going to take me about an hour and a half.\" For weeks now, Taylor and her son have worried about the road, which they say continues to slip down the hill. \"It's not just fear for my child,\" Josh Taylor said. \"There's a lot of kids that ride on a school bus through here. There's a fear of a lot of kids going in this river, and that river is cold as ice.\" Friday, the West Virginia Department of Transportation decided to close the road over fears it could quite literally slip into the river below. \"The last couple of days we've noticed the slip getting a little worse,\" WVDOT Spokesperson Carrie Bly said. \"Then we had a water main break in the area. So, you have all that water coming. Then you have the rain water, and now it's just gotten to the point where it's too dangerous for us to let traffic go across that.\" Crews spent the day repairing the water main break. They believe the only thing holding the road on the side of the hill is a big tree. The Department of Transportation says a full repair won't come anytime soon. \"It comes down to safety, and in the long run we hope people be patient with us,\" Bly said. \"We will get that road fixed, and it will be safer for everyone.\" The WVDOT does not have the funding to fix the road, at least not currently. The DOT says there are several detours for families now cut off from taking Little Coal River Road.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-12-06T00:00:00.000","distance":"2.09924","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.8131,38.3046]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5677","key":"SJ3UKDdBU","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"38.304600000000001","location_accuracy":"Known_within_5_km","longitude":"-81.813100000000006","near":"Alum Creek","nearest_places":"Coal River Rd, Lincoln County, Wv","population":"1749","source_link":"http://www.wsaz.com/news/headlines/Lincoln-Co-Road-Closed-Could-Slip-into-River-234811221.html","source_name":"www.wsaz.com","trigger":"Other","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

According to Adam Long, Brooks Lakes Lodge general manager, there was no warning, just a cracking noise followed by Ã’a huge dust cloudÃ“ that completely blocked the view of the Pinnacles, followed by the ground rumbling. Ã’There was dust everywhere, you could actually see and ÃŠsmell it from the Lodge,Ã“ he said. The Pinnacles is one of the most photographed features west of Dubois and is featured in local and state tourism information. In a phone interview with ÃŠCentral Wyoming College Geology professor Suki Smaglik, she ÃŠnoted that the Pinnacles formation was composed of very loosely consolidated volcanic rock known as volcanic breccias which, even without the unusually high amount of rain and snow, was unstable. Smaglik said the formation was laid down in the Eocene Era, some 50 million years ago from volcanic action. Ã’The material there is from mountains that are now gone. The material is like what is found in the Cascades, itÃ•s volcanic debris.Ã“ The CWC professor also said a contributing factor could have been a very wet September, but thatÃ•s just a possibility. Ã’ItÃ•s not a surprise that a rock slide occurred,Ã“ she said, Ã’they happen there all the time, but not on this scale usually.Ã“ ÃŠSmaglik also noted that with additional snow, freezing and thawing, more rock slides could occur. Brooks Lake Lodge maintenance manager Brian Miller witnessed the event, saying it ÃŠÃ“felt like a huge earthquakeÃ“ and sounded at first like a high powered rifle being shot. He said that the slide area is near the east side of the Pinnacles trailhead. He said he was immediately concerned for any hunters that might have been in that area. MillerÃ•s wife, Antonia Armenta-Miller, executive chef at the Lodge noted, Ã“ the breadth and width of the slide is just phenomenal.Ã“ There are no reports of any injuries or of any missing people in the area.

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months. The mudslides washed thousands Ã‘ and possibly millions Ã‘ of yards of mud, rock and debris off the upper slopes and down into the canyon, and much of it entered the river. According to biologists and scientists, the river should be able to clean and restore itself, but that depends on whether more slides occur and whether thereÃ•s enough river flows to clean out the channel. Terry Hardy, soil scientist for the Boise National Forest, said several things are currently in play. The slides that already occurred are more than likely a one-shot deal. They arenÃ•t going to move on that scale again, but could become Ã’chronic bleedersÃ•Ã• of sediment into the river after future rain storms and snowmelt. Slides at Rough Creek and above Reclamation Village spread into broad deltas that could be contoured with earth-moving equipment and replanted to reduce further erosion. Steeper creek drainages, such as Pierce and Granite creeks, could continue to spew mud until they stabilize. Other drainages could still slide, especially with so many slopes laid bare by intense fires.

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months. The mudslides washed thousands Ã‘ and possibly millions Ã‘ of yards of mud, rock and debris off the upper slopes and down into the canyon, and much of it entered the river. According to biologists and scientists, the river should be able to clean and restore itself, but that depends on whether more slides occur and whether thereÃ•s enough river flows to clean out the channel. Terry Hardy, soil scientist for the Boise National Forest, said several things are currently in play. The slides that already occurred are more than likely a one-shot deal. They arenÃ•t going to move on that scale again, but could become Ã’chronic bleedersÃ•Ã• of sediment into the river after future rain storms and snowmelt. Slides at Rough Creek and above Reclamation Village spread into broad deltas that could be contoured with earth-moving equipment and replanted to reduce further erosion. Steeper creek drainages, such as Pierce and Granite creeks, could continue to spew mud until they stabilize. Other drainages could still slide, especially with so many slopes laid bare by intense fires. The half inch of rain that fell Sept. 12 was not unusual Ã‘ but it fell in about 45 minutes, which is a brief period for that much rain. Hardy said the burned and bare slopes magnify the effects of storms. For example, a 10-year weather event could have the effects of a 15- or 20-year event, he said. ItÃ•s difficult to know how much rain or snowmelt it will take to trigger more slides. Ã’ThereÃ•s a high level of concern, primarily because weÃ•ve seen what can happen,Ã•Ã• Hardy said. But itÃ•s possible we could have already seen the worst, he said. Ã’I donÃ•t know if there are that many more tributaries that could release and have that kind of an effect,Ã•Ã• he said.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-09-12T00:00:00.000","distance":"27.816109999999998","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.5397,43.3575]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5512","key":"DG2cJGFKW","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"43.357500000000002","location_accuracy":"Known_within_1_km","longitude":"-115.5397","near":"Mountain Home","nearest_places":"Rough Creekâ€Ž, Boise National Forest, Idaho","population":"14206","source_link":"http://magicvalley.com/news/local/fire-mudslide-transform-south-fork-of-boise-river/article_50a2c0b0-313f-11e3-af0a-001a4bcf887a.html","source_name":"magicvalley.com","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

The most outstanding feature of this so-called Bolivarian revolution has been the lack of investment in development plans in any of the areas that are vital to the country. As a consequence, PDVSA, the national electricity system, the public transportation system, the potable water system, the sewage system, and garbage collection (or lack of it) are all showing serious signs of deterioration, this being the hallmark of ChÃ¡vezâ€™s style of government. Much less has there been any urban planning that takes into account the public services that will be required as a result of natural population growth.  Another area that reflects the failure of the â€œrevolutionâ€™sâ€\u009d government is the countryâ€™s infrastructure, particularly the roads. Here the Bolivarians have not hit on ways to maintain existing infrastructure or to invest in the building of new roads. It is no longer just that it let the Caracas-La Guaira Viaduct collapse or that it failed to find a lasting solution to the problem of La Cabrera Tunnel or that it turned a deaf ear to warnings by experts of the risks posed by the bridges over the Orinoco River and Lake Maracaibo. Now people all around the country are suffering the consequences of the governmentâ€™s ineptitude, finding themselves penned in because urban and interurban roads are full of potholes, blocked by landslides or have partly disappeared after huge chunks have fallen into the abyss. Some weeks ago, the national press reported that MÃ©rida was completely cut off owing to landslides on the road that connects it to Barinitas and Barinas. Another landslide kept the stretch of the Charallave National Highway that links it up with the Central Regional Highway closed between July 3 and July 9, complicating things for traffic going to Maracay and Valencia.  Last week, part of the Valle-Coche Freeway, in the area of Fuerte Tiuna, collapsed owing to a mega hole -more than 2 meters deep and two lanes wide- caused by a burst water pipe (for which Hidrocapital is responsible).  Now people are warning of the risk the Pan-American Highway (Los Teques-Caracas) is running of collapsing owing to a huge hole at Km 25, which started to appear a year ago and has already eaten away two lanes.  In its eagerness to expropriate and plunder the property of private businesses, the government has neglected what should be its main concern: the well-being of the citizens and the development of the country by setting it on the path to prosperity.","continentcode":"SA","country":"Venezuela","countrycode":"VE","countryname":"Venezuela","date":"2011-07-03T00:00:00.000","distance":"14.28266","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-67.3097,10.3606]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"3722","key":"sJvM4tgBW","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"10.3606","location_accuracy":"Unknown","longitude":"-67.309700000000007","near":"El Consejo","nearest_places":"A stretch of the Charallave National Highway that links it up with the Central Regional Highway, Venezuela","population":"0","source_link":"http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=406529&CategoryId=13303","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

They thought they'd be safe there. But a wall of water was heading their way, and the ground behind the house where they were staying was becoming so saturated it was ready to slide. The small town of Salina -- at the junction of Fourmile Canyon and Gold Run Road -- was hit hard by the devastating 100-year flood. \"We were only asleep for about a half-hour when the mudslide happened,\" Grainger said. A sheet of water, mud and sediment filled the house, slamming Grainger into the wall. She was trapped against the door, with water quickly rising up to her chest. \"It was chaos,\" she said. \"Everyone was screaming.\" Wading around in the 55-degree water, barefoot, in the pitch black with the roar of the fast-moving water, LeGoff tried to locate his wife. \"When something you love is going to be taken away from you, you find a way to save it. You don't stop,\" he said. \"I thought in 30 seconds I would lose everything I had -- my wife, my two dogs, the two cats. I was on my way to losing everything.\" Once LeGoff reached his wife, he realized she was trapped. \"I remember looking at Michelle when she said, 'Steve, I don't want to die this way.' I looked back and said, 'You are not going to die this way.'\" He tried to smash windows, but when that didn't work he kicked out the door behind his wife. \"That's when the water had a place to escape, and the water went down,\" LeGoff said. Their dog was buried in the mud, but the couple saved her by tugging her out of the mud, removing mud from her mouth and resuscitating her, they said. \"All I could think to do is to breathe into her mouth, so I start blowing and screaming at her,\" Grainger said. LeGoff said he and a friend garnered the strength to lift three microwave-sized boulders off of Grainger. She was finally freed. Elsewhere in the house, their neighbor was trapped in a bedroom. Grainger went to get help from others to dig him out of the mud. The families escaped to another house in town on higher ground and spent the rest of the night there. All of their pets were accounted for, including their cat, which had suffered a broken leg. In two separate rescue missions, the two families and their pets were all airlifted out by a Black Hawk helicopter. Grainger had suffered a compression fracture in her back and two broken ribs. \"It's unbelievable that we all got out,\" LeGroff said. Grainger and LeGoff have no plans to move out of the Fourmile Canyon area. \"We were hit really bad by this flood, but we are going to find a way. There has to be a way,\" Grainger said. \"Salina is our family; we have lived here for 22 years. We can't imagine living anywhere else.\" 'We can't rebuild on that land' While evacuating their Salina home, Sean and Meg McCroskey made an unspoken pact to maintain a facade of normalcy during the flooding and everything that followed to protect their two sons, Greyson, 4, and Carter, 3. When they learned that their 2,200-square-foot home had been reduced to rubble at the breakfast table of a friend they were staying with, they just looked at each other, trying not to let the shock and sadness show on their faces. They each hiked down alone to the pile of rubble that was their home for a private moment of grieving, but since then, like many Boulder County families affected by the flood, they've been in survival and recovery mode. \"Sometimes I feel like I go through the grieving process quickly,\" said Meg McCroskey, 36. \"I bawled and I sobbed, but you have two little guys, you gotta keep it together. You have to be optimistic. You have to move on.\" The McCroskeys' house is a total loss. One car is stranded near their home with no way to drive it down out of the mountains. They have no flood insurance. They expect to get help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but the maximum amount of aid they were told they could receive from FEMA is roughly $32,000, Meg McCroskey said. With help and donations from friends and strangers through an online fundraising site, though, the McCroskeys say they'll find a way to get back to normal. Sean McCroskey, who works for data storage provider NetApp, began communicating with his boss Clint Owens shortly after they evacuated. Owens, who lives in Portland, Ore., set up a fundraising page through the websiteGoFundMe.com, and within a week, friends, neighbors and complete strangers from around the world had amassed tens of thousands of dollars for the McCroskeys. As of Friday night, they had raised more than $81,000. Owens said it's been \"amazing to watch the giving nature of people.\" The money and well wishes will make life a little easier in the coming months and years as they attempt to find \"normal\" again, Sean McCroskey said. \"I'm not unlike anybody else in this world,\" he said. \"I work hard and I've worked hard for a long time to have what I had, and just to have that be taken away from you in an instant, it's hard. It's just hard.\" Certain areas near their home have washed out every time it's rained since the Fourmile Fire of 2010, and the evening of Sept. 11, the McCroskey family thought the area near their home might flood. They moved their truck and boat out of that washout zone and went to bed, not thinking much of the heavy rain that kept falling in Boulder County. When they woke up the next morning, their driveway culvert had washed out, and Gold Run Creek -- normally no wider than a sidewalk -- was rushing furiously over top of their driveway. One of their cars was hanging precariously off a newly formed cliff by its two front tires. The rushing waters kept eroding away the McCroskeys' land. At about 5 p.m. Sept. 12, the creek caught hold of the other side of the house and started eating away at the land under their home. Sean and Meg McCroskey packed up some food and clothing in their two heavy-duty backpacking packs and grabbed the cat, Franklin, and dog, Gretta. The young family began hiking uphill to their friend Pete Brady's house, with Greyson and Carter splashing in puddles along the way. While they hiked, Franklin, a jet-black, 1-year-old kitten, clawed his way out of Meg McCroskey's arms. \"I couldn't hold him anymore. Greyson was like, 'Mommy, we're going to have to let him go. We're going to have to leave him.'\" They spent the night with Brady and in the morning called a neighbor across the street, who informed the McCroskeys that their two-story, grey-blue home had collapsed. Later, when Sean McCroskey hiked down to their home, he called for the skinny black cat and found him, miraculously unharmed, in a patch of sun near the house. \"I walked up to him, and his motor starts purring,\" Sean McCroskey, 42, said. \"I sit down and hang out with him for a second. He sits on my lap. I'm talking to him about the night he had and the night we had.\" He carried Franklin, kicking and yowling, back to Brady's house. On the afternoon of Sept. 13, they hiked to the top of Melvina Hill Road and waited almost three hours for the weather to clear so that a National Guard helicopter could land. Sean McCroskey hiked the five miles down to Boulder with their dog while Meg McCroskey, the two boys and the cat were airlifted out of the mountains. Friends in Superior took the McCroskeys in that night. When Sean McCrosky woke up Sept. 14, the full weight of his family's situation fell on him. Everyone -- including the cat and dog -- was safe. He sobbed alone in his temporary room. \"It was the release of dealing with the whole fiasco,\" he said. \"To be somewhere where you don't have to worry about, 'Are we safe? Is there power, water? Is my son going to have something to eat?'\" The McCroskeys will soon move into a long-term hotel paid for by Sean McCroskey's company. They have no longer-term housing plans: They don't want to leave their mountain community, but they're not sure they can afford to rebuild in Salina. The McCroskeys moved to that blue house with white trim in June 2010, and on Labor Day that year, they were evacuated during the Fourmile Fire. Six weeks later, they moved back home, settled in with their new charred landscape and became part of the close-knit community that is Salina. \"There's not much we can do,\" Meg McCroskey said. \"We can't rebuild on that land. We'd have to build it all back up and start over, and I'm not sure we'd be able to afford that.\"","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-09-12T00:00:00.000","distance":"9.5461200000000002","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.3724,40.0505]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5517","key":"S9bhN9gB7","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"40.0505","location_accuracy":"Known_within_5_km","longitude":"-105.3724","near":"Boulder","nearest_places":"Salina, Colorado","population":"97385","source_link":"http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder-flood/ci_24144772/salina-residents-made-narrow-escapes-homes-were-flattened","source_name":"www.dailycamera.com","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

A draft horse mired in a mudslide at an Estes Park resort was rescued by an excavator operator who \"very gently\" used a big metal bucket to scoop up the mud and the horse and move it to solid ground.

Some parked cars were buried in a several feet of mud. There were 25 horses in the stable area and all were unharmed, except for Rosie, a draft horse who became mired in several feet of watery mud. Employees tried unsuccessfully to help free the exhausted horse, which was buried up to its hips in mud, Naldjian said.

The heavy equipment operator, Dan Crane, extended the excavator boom and used the steel bucket to scoop up the mud under the horse, lifting Rosie with it, Naldjian said. \"He very gently reached over with the crane and pulled (the horse) up with the mud,\" Naldjian said.

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months. The mudslides washed thousands Ã‘ and possibly millions Ã‘ of yards of mud, rock and debris off the upper slopes and down into the canyon, and much of it entered the river. According to biologists and scientists, the river should be able to clean and restore itself, but that depends on whether more slides occur and whether thereÃ•s enough river flows to clean out the channel. Terry Hardy, soil scientist for the Boise National Forest, said several things are currently in play. The slides that already occurred are more than likely a one-shot deal. They arenÃ•t going to move on that scale again, but could become Ã’chronic bleedersÃ•Ã• of sediment into the river after future rain storms and snowmelt. Slides at Rough Creek and above Reclamation Village spread into broad deltas that could be contoured with earth-moving equipment and replanted to reduce further erosion. Steeper creek drainages, such as Pierce and Granite creeks, could continue to spew mud until they stabilize. Other drainages could still slide, especially with so many slopes laid bare by intense fires. The half inch of rain that fell Sept. 12 was not unusual Ã‘ but it fell in about 45 minutes, which is a brief period for that much rain. Hardy said the burned and bare slopes magnify the effects of storms. For example, a 10-year weather event could have the effects of a 15- or 20-year event, he said.

In the southern state of Oaxaca, which was affected by both storms, authorities said a child died after being swept away by a swollen river and a teenager was killed by a landslide. The hurricane center said Ingrid, the second hurricane of the Atlantic storm season, could reach the Mexican mainland by Monday morning. Manuel was expected to dump 10 to 15 inches of rain over parts of Guerrero and Michoacan state, with maximums of 25 inches possible in some isolated areas. Authorities said those rains would present an especially dangerous threat in mountains, where flash floods and mudslides were possible. Ingrid also was expected to dump very heavy rains. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and was centered about 125 miles (200 kilometers) east-northeast of the port city of Tampico as it moved northwest at 3 mph (6 kph). A hurricane warning was in effect from Cabo Rojo to La Pesca. In Tamaulipas state to the north, where Ingrid was expected to come ashore, the government said in a statement that Independence Day festivities were cancelled in the cities of Tampico, Madero and Altamira. The Sept. 15 and 16 celebrations commemorate Mexico's battle of independence from Spain. Officials in the Gulf state of Veracruz began evacuating coastal residents Friday night, and civil protection authorities said that more than 6,600 people had been moved to shelters or the homes of family and friends. More than 1,000 homes in Veracruz state had been affected by the storm to varying degrees, and 20 highways and 12 bridges had damage, the state's civil protection authority said. A bridge collapsed near the northern Veracruz city of Misantla on Friday, cutting off the area from the state capital, Xalapa. A week ago, 13 people died in the state when a landslide buried their homes in heavy rains spawned by Tropical Depression Fernand.","continentcode":"NA","country":"Mexico","countrycode":"MX","countryname":"Mexico","date":"2013-09-14T00:00:00.000","distance":"11.834899999999999","fatalities":"1","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.6045,17.1933]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5526","key":"DGARNJFKU","landslide_size":"Very_large","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"17.193300000000001","location_accuracy":"Unknown","longitude":"-96.604500000000002","near":"San AndrÃ©s Huayapan","nearest_places":"Oaxaca","population":"3630","source_link":"http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130915/NEWS/130919814/-1/SITEMAP","source_name":"www.recordonline.com","storm_name":"Ingrid","trigger":"Tropical_Cyclone","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÃ•s cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ã‘ and this could just be the start of it. After talking to numerous experts about the fires and slides, thereÃ•s no consensus on what the future holds because the changes are still happening. But all signs point to a long-term recovery. Using previous fires, even a fairly recent one, as a predictor of what will happen is difficult because of the intensity of the Elk Complex Fire. Many fires leave patches of areas burned and others untouched, but the Elk Complex was unusually intense, and in many areas, it burned everything in its path. David Olson, public information officer for the Boise National Forest, said the Elk Complex burned 276,000 acres during three weeks, including 180,000 acres in 48 hours. By comparison, last summerÃ•s Trinity Fire in the South ForkÃ•s headwaters burned 160,000 acres during two months. The mudslides washed thousands Ã‘ and possibly millions Ã‘ of yards of mud, rock and debris off the upper slopes and down into the canyon, and much of it entered the river. According to biologists and scientists, the river should be able to clean and restore itself, but that depends on whether more slides occur and whether thereÃ•s enough river flows to clean out the channel. Terry Hardy, soil scientist for the Boise National Forest, said several things are currently in play. The slides that already occurred are more than likely a one-shot deal. They arenÃ•t going to move on that scale again, but could become Ã’chronic bleedersÃ•Ã• of sediment into the river after future rain storms and snowmelt. Slides at Rough Creek and above Reclamation Village spread into broad deltas that could be contoured with earth-moving equipment and replanted to reduce further erosion. Steeper creek drainages, such as Pierce and Granite creeks, could continue to spew mud until they stabilize. Other drainages could still slide, especially with so many slopes laid bare by intense fires. The half inch of rain that fell Sept. 12 was not unusual Ã‘ but it fell in about 45 minutes, which is a brief period for that much rain. Hardy said the burned and bare slopes magnify the effects of storms. For example, a 10-year weather event could have the effects of a 15- or 20-year event, he said. ItÃ•s difficult to know how much rain or snowmelt it will take to trigger more slides. Ã’ThereÃ•s a high level of concern, primarily because weÃ•ve seen what can happen,Ã•Ã• Hardy said. But itÃ•s possible we could have already seen the worst, he said. Ã’I donÃ•t know if there are that many more tributaries that could release and have that kind of an effect,Ã•Ã• he said.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-09-12T00:00:00.000","distance":"28.846489999999999","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.4769,43.34]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5511","key":"h5ZY99gQ4","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"43.34","location_accuracy":"Known_within_1_km","longitude":"-115.4769","near":"Mountain Home","nearest_places":"Dixie Creekâ€Ž, Boise National Forest, Idaho","population":"14206","source_link":"http://magicvalley.com/news/local/fire-mudslide-transform-south-fork-of-boise-river/article_50a2c0b0-313f-11e3-af0a-001a4bcf887a.html","source_name":"magicvalley.com","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

Hundreds of landslides occurred during the storm that dropped record rains on the Boulder area, Jonathan Godt, a U.S. Geological Survey researcher with the Landslide Hazards Program, reported here Tuesday (Oct. 29) at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America. The damage occurred inside a triangle along Colorado's Front Range Mountains, spanning an area some 1,150 square miles (3,000 square kilometers). Rockslides are a danger even now, more than a month later, Godt said, and will remain so for some time to come. [Photos of Colorado's Landslides] Several days of heavy, tropical-style rain fell in northern Colorado beginning Sept. 9 and intensifying Sept. 11 and 12, when floodwaters began to rise in Boulder (which saw more than 7 inches, or 18 centimeters, of rain in one day) and other foothill towns. Lyons, Colo., was cut off from the outside worldby raging waters; roads snaking through canyons were washed away entirely. East of Denver, the city of Aurora also saw extreme rain and flooding. Three people died in landslides and debris flows during the flooding, including a man in Jamestown, Colo., whose home was hit. There were also many thousands of dollars of uninsured damage to property, Godt said. One building on Arapahoe Avenue in Boulder was cut in half by a landslide. \"That building was formerly one building,\" Godt said. \"Now it's two.\" Landslides spanned the gamut of northern Colorado geology and environments, Godt said. There were slides in Boulder and Golden, both towns in the foothills at elevations around 5,500 feet (1,676 meters). Far above, slides scar Rocky Mountain National Park near the continental divide at about 12,000 feet (3,658 m). The widespread nature of the rain and flooding meant that nothing was safe from slope failures: Sedimentary rocks slid, as did crystalline rocks immediately west of the foothills. Hillsides turned into landslides in residential areas among grasslands and in alpine environments along the treeline. Many of these landslides started off small and gained momentum as they rolled down slopes, Godt said. Some left behind rivers of debris about 6 .5 feet (2 m) thick. Some slides moved boulders 6.5 to 10 feet (2 to 3 m) long as if they were pebbles. Among the most impressive slides was one on the east flank of Twin Sisters Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park. That slide measured between 2.5 to 3 miles (4 to 5 km) long.","continentcode":"NA","country":"UnitedÂ States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-09-12T00:00:00.000","distance":"15.39663","fatalities":"3","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.3896,40.1192]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5501","key":"sJ5D6JmK7","landslide_size":"Very_large","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"40.119199999999999","location_accuracy":"Known_within_50_km","longitude":"-105.3896","near":"Boulder","nearest_places":"Jamestown, Colorado","population":"97385","source_link":"http://news.yahoo.com/landslides-scar-colorado-major-flood-175835064.html","source_name":"news.yahoo.com","time":"1:00:00","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

The mudslide was reported to be around milepost 114, which is between Cow Creek Road, Prairie Road, and Anderson Ranch Dam Road. Elmore County dispatchers report at least one person had to be rescued by boat after Thursday's rainstorm brought soil, mud, and debris rolling down hills onto other nearby roadways. The roadway into Fall Creek, where a number of cabins burned in the Elk Complex Fire, is heavily blocked by boulders and logs. \"[Thursday] night for about a 45-minute period starting around 6:30, we had almost half an inch of rain in a very localized area right around Anderson Ranch Dam,\" U.S. Forest Service spokesman David Olson said. Olson said there are around 10 mudslides around the dam area and the debris briefly clogged the South Fork of the Boise River, cutting the flow in the area by around 60 percent for a time Thursday night. The flows have since returned to normal. \"What's interesting about this storm is it was very localized. So if you go toward Prairie, or if you go toward Pine or Featherville, there is really no impact at all. So it was a very localized but very intense rain storm that created quite a bit of mudflow into the road system, and into the river,\" Olson said. The following roadways remain closed Friday, and some bridges are washed out, according to officials. CLOSURES INCLUDE ÃŠÃŠÃŠ Anderson Ranch Dam Road at U.S. Highway 20 ÃŠÃŠÃŠ Castle Creek Bridge -- washed out ÃŠÃŠÃŠ Cow Creek Road at U.S. Highway 20 ÃŠÃŠÃŠ Fall Creek Road, including nearby bridges ÃŠÃŠÃŠ Granite Creek Road ÃŠÃŠÃŠ Prairie Road to Davison Ranch The closures do not include staffed roadblocks, so drivers are encouraged to be aware of changing conditions. The mudslides and flooding are thought to be spurred by area wildfires, including the Pony and Elk fires, which burned in August. \"With the amount of burn that occurred and the intensity of the burn, there were many people that said this is not an 'if,' but a 'when' situation, and indeed we saw the 'when' already just shortly after the fire was contained,\" Olson said. The rain is also causing problems in Boise County. Campers are being evacuated along Grimes Creek Road where as much as 8 inches of mud covering part of that road tonight.

A mudslide last Thursday temporarily blocked Highway 20 at milepost 114.5, about 18 miles east of Mountain Home, between the Cow Creek/Prairie Road and the Anderson Dam Road. It took about two hours for the slide to be cleared. But that wasn't the only incident, just one of the more visible ones. The short but intense rain event Thursday created numerous flash floods in the area of the Elk Fire Complex along the South Fork Boise River area from Granite Creek, extending east of the Anderson Ranch Dam to Fall Creek. Ten major drainages had significant mud and debris flows that went over the road system and into the South Fork Boise River and Anderson Ranch Reservoir. In addition, at least a half dozen creeks that do not have names had mud flows going across the roads, Forest Service officials said. An Anderson Ranch Dam rain gauge showed nearly half an inch of rain occurred between 6:30-7:15 p.m. Thursday night. Hydrologists with the Burned Area Emergency Response team that had evaluated the burned areas had estimated a half-inch rain event on the severely burned soils would create flash floods. Elmore County closed several roads accessing the area and the Mountain Home Highway District personnel are working to open the roads. Creeks affected included Pearce, Granite, Rough, Dixie, Mill, Elk, Wilson, Evans, Castle and the Reclamation Village area. The storm was localized and the Prairie and Pine- Featherville areas did not report any damage. Due to the storm event, the South Fork Boise River remains closed, which will prohibit rafting from the Cow Creek Bridge downstream to the confluence with Arrowrock Reservoir. The closure is due to the current heavy volume of sediment, logs and other debris in the river. \"We are very concerned of a boater starting a trip downriver in this isolated and limited communication section of the river,\" said Cecilia Seesholtz, Boise National Forest Supervisor. \"This local area has been hit hard and a lot of work will need to be done to clear the roads and lessen the risks in the river over the upcoming days.\" \"With the volume of mud coming down the creeks from (Thursday) night's event, and the potential for more flash floods, the public really needs to be aware of hazards,\" Seesholtz added. \"People should not park in drainages, near trees and be very aware of weather forecasts that call for rain or high winds.\" For additional details, contact the Mountain Home Ranger District at 587-7961","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-09-12T00:00:00.000","distance":"22.84271","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.4953,43.2804]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5504","key":"sJGjG9gKU","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"43.2804","location_accuracy":"Known_within_10_km","longitude":"-115.4953","near":"Mountain Home","nearest_places":"Sun Valley Hwyâ€Ž, Mountain Home, Id","population":"14206","source_link":"http://www.mountainhomenews.com/story/2004884.html","source_name":"www.mountainhomenews.com","time":"evening","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

According to the Coconino County SheriffÃ•s Office, the 27-year-old victim was trapped in a rock slide as he attempted to move one large boulder from the middle of Elden Lookout Road shortly before 7:30 a.m. A second boulder weighing more than 30 tons slid down the mountainside, crushing his legs and pelvic area. Four men who were traveling with the victim managed to free him before rescue crews arrived. The men told investigators the group had come up from the Phoenix area to work on one of the radio towers on Mount Elden.ÃŠ A SheriffÃ•s Office patrol sergeant and corporal were the first to arrive on the scene. They found the victim and his travel companions more than three miles up from the bottom of the mountain. According to the SheriffÃ•s Office, the manÃ•s legs and pelvis had been severely injured by the weight of the boulder.ÃŠ First responders from the Summit Fire Department and Guardian Medical Transport also attempted to reach the victim. However, road conditions prevented the ambulance and fire truck from going up the mountain. The batallion chief for Guardian Medical Transport and a SheriffÃ•s sergeant had to use four-wheel-drive vehicles to bring additional rescue personnel to the injured man.ÃŠ An SUV also had to carry the victim down the mountain to a waiting ambulance because there was no safe place for a Search and Rescue helicopter to land. The injured man was transferred to an ambulance at the bottom of Mount Elden and transported to Flagstaff Medical Center for treatment. The rock slide has prompted the Flagstaff Ranger District of the Coconino National Forest to close Elden Lookout Road to vehicles starting at the junction with Rocky Ridge Trail. According to Forest Service officials, rain has also caused falling boulders, rockslides, washouts and debris in other areas. That has led to additional closures, including an area closure between Upper Oldham Trail to Sunset Trail. Upper Oldham Trail is closed.ÃŠ There is also a one-mile stretch on the north end of Schultz Pass Road that is closed to through traffic. That road is accessible from Highway 180 and Elden Springs Road. High-clearance vehicles are required on Elden Springs Road and on Schultz Pass Road north of the Elden Springs Road junction. Officials with the Flagstaff Ranger District are urging anyone who visits the forest to use caution. Cape Royal Road on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has been closed through the end of the season because of construction and damage from flooding. The North Kaibab Trail below Supai Tunnel and the South Kaibab Trail below Cedar Ridge have sustained damage and are closed to stock animals until early October. Both trails are still open to hikers, who should use extreme caution when traversing washed-out sections.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-09-10T00:00:00.000","distance":"7.3912199999999997","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.6179,35.2588]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5489","injuries":"1","key":"S9vJS5dc7","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"35.258800000000001","location_accuracy":"Known_within_5_km","longitude":"-111.61790000000001","near":"Flagstaff","nearest_places":"Mount Elden, Az","population":"65870","source_link":"http://azdailysun.com/news/local/landslide-injures-man-on-elden/article_b614c870-1aa2-11e3-bce1-0019bb2963f4.html","source_name":"azdailysun.com","time":"7:30:00","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

Officials said there were some two dozen aftershocks overnight, as they placed the nation on orange alert, one below the highest level red. The temblor caused cuts in power, interruptions in phone service and landslides, and was felt as far away as neighboring El Salvador and in southern Mexico. But there were no casualties reported from the quake, which according to U.S. seismologists struck 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from Pajapita, Guatemala at a depth of 67.7 kilometers at 0013 GMT Saturday. Southeastern Mexico was also jolted by at least three aftershocks, including one with a magnitude of 6.1 felt near Ciudad Hidalgo, in the state of Chiapas, close to the Guatemalan border. After the initial quake, residents had already evacuated their homes in several towns in the southern Mexican state while power was lost temporarily in Ciudad Hidalgo. The Environmental Observatory in San Salvador said the quake was centered on the coast of Guatemala and Mexico, measuring its strength slightly lower at 6.3 on the Richter scale. And the US Geological Survey said that the quake was just 20 kilometers (12 miles) northeast of Suchiate, a municipality in the Mexican state of Chiapas, on the border with Guatemala. A second tremblor, measuring 5.4 in magnitude, occurred seven minutes later, according to the USGS, with its epicenter in the Pacific waters of Guatemala. Guatemalan President Otto Perez took to Twitter to say authorities were Ã’conducting nationwide monitoring to assess the damage that may have been caused.Ã“","continentcode":"NA","country":"Guatemala","countrycode":"GT","countryname":"Guatemala","date":"2013-09-07T00:00:00.000","distance":"0.96647000000000005","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.0335,14.7254]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5475","key":"SJ7D8GFQU","landslide_size":"Large","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"14.7254","location_accuracy":"Unknown","longitude":"-92.033500000000004","near":"Pajapita","nearest_places":"Pajapita","population":"8164","source_link":"http://www.chinapost.com.tw/international/americas/2013/09/09/388474/Power-outages.htm","source_name":"www.chinapost.com.tw","time":"0:13:00","trigger":"Earthquake","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

We need to get that cleaned out before there is more water.\" Alpine had nearly four inches of rain over the weekend, much of it coming down during one extended burst. The resulting mudslide forced the largest evacuation of homes here in recent memory. The slide was the fourth in 2013, the result of a massive wildfire that denuded the mountain last year. To clear the diversion path, the city has brought in three massive hauling trucks and a backhoe. One road in Box Elder was closed to allow crews space to work. More than 1,100 volunteers turned up on Sunday to fill sandbags, which now line Moyle Drive and form a continuous wall along Alpine Boulevard. \"The sandbagging is finished for right now,\" Nelson said. \"I want to say thanks to Lehi city for delivering sand to us, and Utah County shared with us some bags for sand when we were running low. We got help from all the cities around.\" With work now going as fast as possible, the best the city can hope for is a break from the rain. That break may not come. Weather forecasts showed a chance for rain beginning before midnight on Monday and continuing through the early hours of Tuesday. Trevor Lott, working in Box Elder, said he was expecting rain at midnight and throughout the week. He said he had worked nonstop on Sunday clearing mud from Box Elder subdivision, and it didn't look like he'd get a break anytime soon. \"Alpine is probably not going to get significant rain tonight,\" said Larry Dunn, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Salt Lake City, speaking on Monday afternoon. \"They will see rain perhaps Tuesday night and especially Wednesday and Thursday.\" Right now, the forecast is for sustained, widespread light rain, rather than the kind of heavy deluge that caused Saturday's slide. \"It does not look real heavy at this time but that could change,\" Dunn said, noting that Alpine will be on the edge of a \"ragged storm\" and a more precise forecast would not be possible until closer to the event.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-09-07T00:00:00.000","distance":"3.0621999999999998","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.751,40.4733]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5479","key":"SJ5iG5dK4","landslide_size":"Small","landslide_type":"Debris_Flow","latitude":"40.473300000000002","location_accuracy":"Known_within_1_km","longitude":"-111.751","near":"Highland","nearest_places":"Box Elder Drive, Alpine, Utah","population":"15523","source_link":"http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/north/alpine/alpine-furiously-preparing-for-more-rain/article_b1e25043-2521-5538-b728-6dc8fce8dd59.html","source_name":"www.heraldextra.com","time":"evening","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

It had been more than a year since the enormous Waldo Canyon Fire roared across the slopes above. But its burn scar is just beginning to recover, with little plant material Ã‘ living or dead Ã‘ to absorb this yearÃ•s late-summer rains. So when the storm came on Aug. 9, the runoff raced down, destroying or damaging 36 homes, engulfing half a dozen cars and killing John Collins, who was driving home from work. Manitou Springs was smeared with reddish mud and debris. Wildfire burn scars have spawned flash floods up and down ColoradoÃ•s Front Range and in other Western states this summer, saddling communities with millions of dollars in cleanup costs and leaving residents fearful and anxious. Ã’IÃ•m moving out,Ã“ Manitou Springs resident Donna Stone said after the August flood narrowly missed her house. Ã’ItÃ•s incomprehensible to me that I would be safe here.Ã“ The threat lingers years after the flames have been extinguished and the human and property losses of fire have been tallied. In New Mexico, where fires have scorched more than 285 square miles of mountain slopes this year, flash floods killed fish and washed out roads in Pecos Canyon, a popular fishing area. Homes near Flagstaff, Ariz., were flooded after rainfall on an area burned in 2010. Two other floods hit in July below ArizonaÃ•s Yarnell Hill, where 19 firefighters were killed on June 30. In Colorado, multiple flash floods have struck this summer in or near scars left by last yearÃ•s Waldo Canyon and High Park fires. The High Park Fire burned more than 136 square miles in Larimer County west of Fort Collins, killing one person and destroying nearly 260 homes. Waldo Canyon erupted days later near Colorado Springs, burning more than 28 square miles, killing two people and destroying nearly 350 homes. State officials expect to spend at least $10 million to repair flood-damaged roads and bridges in the two areas and to keep them open. Water utilities in Colorado Springs, Greeley and Fort Collins expect to spend more than $20 million Ã‘ including federal grants Ã‘ to repair and protect their systems in the burn areas. Manitou Springs has spent more than $130,000 on cleanup, City Administrator Jack Benson said. The city is looking into buying up to four houses in the flood area and using the land for a retention pond or some other flood control project, if funding can be found, he said. No single agency compiles the cost of erosion and floods caused by wildfires, but the U.S. Forest Service spent nearly $46 million nationwide in fiscal 2012 on emergency erosion measures. The money paid for mulch to absorb rain, shoring up roads and trails, and reseeding. Getting longer-term restoration money isnÃ•t easy. In June, the gridlocked Congress finally approved $19 million for erosion control for ColoradoÃ•s 2012 wildfires after months of lobbying by ColoradoÃ•s Democratic senators. Rain normally is soaked up by a sponge-like layer of pine needles and twigs on the forest ground, called duff. Wildfires can incinerate that layer, and burning duff can leave a waxy residue in the top layer of soil that sheds water. A relatively light rain can rush down charred hillsides into streambeds, picking up dirt, ash, rock and tree limbs along the way. Ã’ItÃ•s like concrete soup coming down,Ã“ said Eric Billmeyer, an instructor of geology and environmental studies at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs. It could be a decade before all the damage plays out, said Dale Miller, road and bridge director for Larimer County. Ã’We expect that as a result of the fire, any storm that we receive today is going to cause potentially 10 times the damage it would have before the fire,Ã“ Miller said. Denver Water, the stateÃ•s largest municipal utility, is still spending millions of dollars to stem erosion 12 years after the Hayman Fire, then ColoradoÃ•s largest ever, burned across 215 square miles in the foothills south of Denver. Ã’ItÃ•s going to take a very long time for these areas to stabilize,Ã“ Billmeyer said. Ã’Even with all the work thatÃ•s being done out there, really, you have to have the vegetation be restored.Ã“","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-08-09T00:00:00.000","distance":"1.6062099999999999","fatalities":"1","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.9342,38.854]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5299","key":"S9qPM9FKW","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Debris_Flow","latitude":"38.853999999999999","location_accuracy":"Known_within_15_km","longitude":"-104.9342","near":"Manitou Springs","nearest_places":"Manitou Springs, Colo","population":"4992","source_link":"http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/263911-flood-brings-mudslide-to-area-ravaged-by-wildfire/?photo=2","source_name":"www.theepochtimes.com","time":"night","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

Spooks Branch Road and an area near the intersection of Skyview Place and Sunset Drive, all in North Asheville, experienced landslides earlier this month due to heavy rains. Both instances resulted in lane or road closures. Assessment of the projectsÃ• scope began as soon as weather and the soil stability on site permitted. Because of the magnitude of their damage, the Skyview and Spooks Branch locations required working with outside contractors. Ã’We initiated an aggressive schedule,Ã“ said Streets and Engineering Services Manager Greg Shuler. During the bank restoration and repair, some road and lane closures are expected. During that time, barricades and markers will be used to indicate road or lane closures. In the interest of public safety, motorists are asked to observe markers and not move or drive around barricades. A section of Spooks Branch Road will be closed for approximately three weeks, with periodic single lane closures over the following few weeks. Skyview Place and Sunset Drive are also currently closed to through traffic. Surrounding residences may also experience occasional water interruptions during construction. See water service interruption information at http://www.ci.asheville.nc.us/Departments/Water/WaterOutages.aspx. Work is expected to be completed at Spooks Branch Road on September 21, and at Skyview Place on October 21.City of Asheville Public Works crews are working to remediate several other landslide sites in the Town Mountain and Beaverdam Valley areas. In all, landslides affected nearly 20 sites in the city. As of Thursday morning, city crews had completed work on eight of those locations. Three landslides that have more extensive damage are currently being evaluated by geotechnical engineers to determine the scope of the repair, and will likely require the assistance of outside contractors.

Kaitlyn Dix was home alone around 11:30 p.m. on Thursday when tragedy was compounded by hardship. She had just gotten a call from her mother, Dixie Dix, saying that her grandmother had died. Within five minutes, the mudslide swept through the yard, breaking through a bathroom window and inundating the basement. Firefighters arrived on the doorstep just as her sister, Nicole, arrived home from a concert, and the women were told they had Ã’30 secondsÃ“ to evacuate. They spent the night at a neighborÃ•s home. On Friday morning, their father, Brent Dix, was flying home from out of state. The two daughters were working with crews and neighbors trying to clear mud from the basement, landscaping, and driveway. One neighbor, shoveling mud from the Dix driveway with her young son, understated the scale of the familyÃ•s past 24 hours when she said the mudslide was Ã’bad timing.Ã“ Ã’I had just got home last night and it was flooding our yard and then our basement window blew through and we got two feet of water,Ã“ Nicole Dix told the Daily Herald. Ã’TheyÃ•ve tried to suction as much as they could out.Ã“ She stood in her basement in bare feet, six inches of muck surrounding her.ÃŠ Three houses down the street, Alice Osborne stood in her front yard on Alpine Boulevard assessing the mudslide damage to her landscaping. Ã’It went through our yards and hit the neighbors below us hard,Ã“ she said. No one was hurt. Just hours before the mudslide, on Box Elder Trail street crews had been putting a brick facade on a cement wall built by the city to protect a home directly in the mudslide path. Landscaper Lon Lott told the Daily Herald that on Friday morning, some of a pallet of bricks had been found a half-mile down the mountain after taking a direct hit from the mudslide. Sandbags surrounded the windows of the home, and some mud had damaged the basement. Ã’We got quite a bit of flooding in the North Stake Center area and Moyle Drive,Ã“ Alpine Mayor HuntÃŠ Willoughby told the Daily Herald on Friday morning. Ã’There are lots of properties with layers of mud on them.Ã“ The cityÃ•s new diversion channels and debris basins were simply overwhelmed by the magnitude of the flood.ÃŠ Ã’It filled them and overtopped them,Ã“ he said.ÃŠ Attention now turns back to the weather. The National Weather Service has warned officials here that another storm could bring more flooding Friday night or Saturday. As of 9:30 a.m. Friday, it was already raining again in Alpine. Rainfall continued for another 90 minutes.

A similar warning was in effect until 7:30 p.m. for north central Sanpete County, where heavy rain was expected over the 2012 Wood Hollow burn scar.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-08-01T00:00:00.000","distance":"25.750900000000001","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.1562,39.5366]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5249","key":"D91kh9gB7","landslide_size":"Small","landslide_type":"Debris_Flow","latitude":"39.5366","location_accuracy":"Known_within_5_km","longitude":"-111.1562","near":"Mount Pleasant","nearest_places":"Nuck Woodward Canyon, Ut","population":"3260","source_link":"http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56678877-78/county-emery-milepost-road.html.csp","source_name":"www.sltrib.com","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

Recent heavy rains are to blame as nearly two inches of rain a day, all at once, has caused berms atop the bluff to give in. ItÃ•s happened before but never this bad. Friday, crews worked on what amounts to a short term solution for the mudslide problem. \"Well short term we can get up there and we can break that waterfall. As we are doing now, we are coming down and making small terraces. It's going to hit the area below and itÃ•s going to fall so many feet, it will hit the next terrace and it will go into a retention area. ItÃ•s will leak through that breached area and then the water will go to next level,\" said Public Works Director Jennifer Fidler. \"It is mother nature though,\" said Pamela Valenti, who lives near the bluff. Homeowners who live atop the bluff say a long lasting solution needs to be found to avoid the collapse of any neighborhood roads. \"Look at how beautiful everything up here is. This is a wonderful park and you don't want it to wash away you know, so something definitely needs to be done,\" said Valenti. Fidler said the long term solution is something engineers have done before in other spots along the bluff that have been washed away in the past. \"Long term we want to control that storm water runoff. Instead of just shooting out we want to come out and bring it down and let it settle out in a bigger retention pond,\" said Fidler. Engineers say any new home construction or additions should include pervious driveways and landscaping. Basically anything that will suck up the water cutting down on run-off.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-08-01T00:00:00.000","distance":"0.73828000000000005","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.9085,30.5279]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5245","key":"sGV08GdBU","landslide_size":"Small","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"30.527899999999999","location_accuracy":"Known_within_1_km","longitude":"-87.908500000000004","near":"Fairhope","nearest_places":"Fairhope, Alabama","population":"15326","source_link":"http://www.local15tv.com/template/cgi-bin/archived.pl?type=basic&file=/shared/news/features/top-stories/stories/archive/2013/08/cS7WWUwb.xml#.UtBBHvRDt8E","source_name":"www.local15tv.com","time":"early morning","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

,{":@computed_region_cbhk_fwbd":"37",":@computed_region_nnqa_25f4":"2331","adminname1":"North Carolina","adminname2":"Wilkes County","cat_id":"5216","cat_src":"glc","changeset_id":"1","comments":"Wilkes is among six counties declared eligible for federal aid due to damage on July 27 from landslides and flooding, caused by excessive rain. President Obama approved disaster status for Wilkes, Ashe, Avery, Catawba, Lincoln and Watauga counties on Tuesday, according to a White House press release issued about 10 p.m. Tuesday. The designation makes federal funding available to state and local governments and certain private nonprofit entities on a cost-share basis for emergency work, repairing or replacing facilities damaged by flooding and landslides and for hazard mitigation work, the press release said. The press release said more designations may be made later if requested by the state and warranted by results of more damage assessments. W. Craig Fugate, director of the N.C. Department of Public SafetyÃ•s Division of Emergency Management, named Michael Bolch as the coordinating officer for recovery operations in the six counties. Fugate also is Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrator for North Carolina. Fugate said Wilkes CountyÃ•s estimated cost of damage eligible for federal aid is $687,334, which he said exceeds the threshold for making Wilkes eligible for being declared a disaster area by the federal government. Under the designation approved by the president, Wilkes and the other five counties are eligible for federal aid to help pay for emergency protective measures; water control facilities; removing debris and repairing roads, bridges, buildings, public utilities, parks and other recreational facilities. Fugate said that in Wilkes, the only damage reported and eligible for this federal aid so far is damage to N.C. Department of Transportation roads and bridges. He said no local governments in Wilkes reported public infrastructure damage. Wilkes, Catawba and Lincoln werenÃ•t among counties declared a major disaster area in September by President Barack Obama, based on FEMAÃ•s recommendation, even though they were among 16 counties identified in Gov. Pat McCroryÃ•s request for the designation. On Oct. 23, U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan sent a letter to Fugate supporting North CarolinaÃ•s appeal for federal aid for recovery efforts from the damage in Wilkes, Catawba and Lincoln counties in late July. A spokesman for Mrs. Hagan said Wilkes, Catawba and Lincoln werenÃ•t included because an initial assessment of damage costs in the three counties combined didnÃ•t meet the federal governmentÃ•s threshold ofÃŠ $13,662,150 for being declared a major disaster area. The state appealed FEMAÃ•s denial after assessments completed in October identified more damage, raising the estimated cost in the three counties to $14,032,777. Ã’These damages clearly exceed the stateÃ•s threshold and warrant a finding by FEMA that public assistance funds are necessary in response to these incredibly damaging storms and floods,Ã“ Mrs. Hagan said in the letter to Fugate.Ã“ Mrs. HaganÃ•s letter said federal aid approved for the other 13 western N.C. counties was for damage from July 3-13. It said the assistance sought for Wilkes, Catawba and Lincoln was for damage from July 14-27. As much as 12 inches of rain fell in the mountains of far northwestern Wilkes on July 26 and 27, causing flooding and landslides and damaging Fall Creek, Pumpkin Run, Big Ivy and other roads in the Parsonsville and Purlear areas. Charles Reinhardt, DOT division maintenance engineer, said the worst public road damage in northwestern Wilkes on July 26 and 27 resulted from a large landslide on Fall Creek Road. Only one lane of this paved road is open as repairs, estimated to cost about $750,000, continue. Reinhardt said Tuesday work is about 45 percent complete. Private roads in the Buck Mountain and Range Branch developments were heavily damaged July 26 and 27. The southbound lane of U.S. 21 on the Blue Ridge Mountain escarpment in Wilkes has been closed to traffic since June 11 due to a worsening depression and weakening retainer wall less than a mile from the Alleghany line. Heavy rain this summer worsened the U.S. 21 site, but Reinhardt said repairs are now about three weeks away from completion. He said DOT officials are optimistic about getting Federal Highway Administration funds to help pay for repairs on U.S. 21, estimated to cost about $1.2 million. Severe thunderstorms and heavy rains dumped 10 to over 20 inches of rain over much of the foothills and mountains in July. It was the wettest July on record in many counties, including Wilkes. There was also flood damage in the Roaring River community and elsewhere in Wilkes in July. Farmers suffered the most widespread flood damage in Wilkes this summer, mostly in bottomland cornfields. Included in the designation approved by Obama in September were Alleghany, Ashe, Caldwell, Watauga, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Jackson, Macon, Madison, Mitchell, Polk and Yancey counties and the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians. In September, McCrory said early estimates indicated about $25 million in damage to roads, bridges, culverts, public utilities, parks and schools in western North Carolina this summer. The federal disaster declaration made federal funds available to cover 75 percent of the cost of repairs and debris removal in designated counties.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-07-27T00:00:00.000","distance":"17.741350000000001","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.4311,36.2204]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5216","key":"s9tsHsdKU","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"36.220399999999998","location_accuracy":"Unknown","longitude":"-81.431100000000001","near":"Millers Creek","nearest_places":"Wilkes, Catawba And Lincoln Counties, Nc","population":"2112","source_link":"http://www.journalpatriot.com/news/article_ac204dd6-4184-11e3-89ad-0019bb30f31a.html","source_name":"www.journalpatriot.com","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

In the interest of public safety, motorists are asked to observe markers and not move or drive around barricades. A section of Spooks Branch Road will be closed for approximately three weeks, with periodic single lane closures over the following few weeks.

Engineers are working to determine the extent and cause of the damage.  A mudslide near Kirby Mountain Road between Lenoir and Blowing Rock damaged the road and the guardrail Sunday.  DOT workers poured green die into a storm drain to find out if water from the other side is seeping under the highway.  â€œThe only thing we could tell right now is the water came from the other side of the road and apparently itâ€™s going underneath ground,â€\u009d Gioscio said. â€œOur goal is not to stop traffic, and weâ€™ve got a brand new road here. Thatâ€™s why we opened it up â€“ to keep people moving,â€\u009d  DOT workers say the contractor who widened the roadway is not responsible for the slide. They believe it formed under the old roadway and it will be up to the state to pay for the repairs.  -----  The slide was caused when heavy rains softened the soil and an underground stream of water began to flow out of the hillside.  Last week, Department of Transportation crews put special dyes in water near the site, hoping to be able to track where the problem in the hillside came from. \"We need to find out, it's important,\" said one crew member. Knowing where the water is flowing from is necessary to complete the repairs on the hillside.  District Engineer Frank Gioscio said the DOT's aim is to keep the road open. \"We definitely don't want any more lane closures,\" he said.  A Contractor has been assigned to the repair work and is monitoring the site 24 hours a day to make sure the road stays intact. The slide undercut a portion of one southbound lane but all other lanes are intact and should remain open, said officials.  The mud from the hillside covered Kirby Mountain Road, which sits below and parallel to Highway 321. A barricade is up to keep everyone but those who live down the road from driving on it. The road may be shut down completely during some of the repair work, said the DOT.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2011-03-06T00:00:00.000","distance":"13.119429999999999","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.5949,36.0378]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"3175","key":"s5e3BDdQU","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"36.037799999999997","location_accuracy":"Known_within_1_km","longitude":"-81.594899999999996","near":"Blowing Rock","nearest_places":"rt. 321, above Kirby Mountain rd, north of Lenoir, NC","population":"1241","source_link":"http://www2.hickoryrecord.com/news/2011/mar/10/us-321-mudslide-repairs-may-cost-tens-thousands-do-ar-852188/","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

The heavy rainfall caused its fair share of problems, as many roads and driveways washed out in places and a large sinkhole appeared near the entrance to the Tanger Shoppes on the Parkway.ÃŠHeavy rains on Sunday, July 7, caused a landslide below part of Wonderland Trail, between cliffside houses owned by the Gore family at 1293 Wonderland Trail and the Perry family at 1239 Wonderland Trail.ÃŠTown officials have blocked off a section of the road to traffic.ÃŠBecause the roadway has access out of the Mayview Park neighborhood in both directions, no homeowners are cut off from an access into town.ÃŠOn Monday, Mayor J.B. Lawrence, interim Town Manager Bob Shepard, members of the Blowing Rock Town Council and town engineer Doug Chapman took a field trip to inspect Wonderland Trail and the landslide site.ÃŠÃ’At some point about 18 years ago, the town came in and put an additional 12 feet of road in this area. They built rock baskets, some of them on concrete footings, some of them not on footings. The ones not on concrete footings have blown out in places,Ã“ Chapman said.Where the landslide occurred is some of the steepest rock face in the High Country.

This section of the road will be closed until it is fixed,Ã“ he said. Monica Perry, one of the two homeowners directly affected by the landslide, allowed Chapman and the others onto the deck of her house for a better look at the landslide.ÃŠRocks, fallen trees and other debris were strewn down the mountainside for at least 50 feet, just past the Perry residence. A locust stump appeared to hold an old rock wall from falling during the landslide.ÃŠÃ’The landslide took out some really nice plants that I had planted out there.

The latest slide happened about five miles up the canyon and closed the road from about 11:30 p.m. Friday to 6:30 a.m. Saturday, said Utah Department of Transportation spokesman Adan Carrillo. The slide was not as extensive asÃŠthose that trapped a family and other visitors until about 3 p.m. Friday, though Carrillo said the debris washed over the road in one of the same spots crews had previously cleared. He attributed the slide to the rain that fell late Friday. \"It wasnÃ•t as much rain this time so the cleanup wasnÃ•t as extensive,\" Carrillo added. Monica Traphagan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said Snowbird received about 0.7 inch of rain during a storm late Friday. The storm was part of an especially moist air mass moving over Utah. \"ItÃ•s not unheard of,\" Traphagan said of the wetness, \"but itÃ•s certainly unusual for us.\" Thursday night and Friday morning, 1.47 inches of rain fell at Alta, which is up-canyon from both rock slides. According to Carrillo, a UDOT supervisor who has worked in Little Cottonwood Canyon for 30 years said that in the last decade he hasnÃ•t seen anything similar to the latest series of slides. The impact of the Friday night slide on traffic was minimal, Carrillo said. Authorities remained on high alert Saturday and were monitoring the area for other potentially dangerous spots.

But some people who live around the property at 145 Black Oak Drive say the site is still unstable and the county should do more to prevent another slide like the one that blocked the street this summer and threatened other homes. Remaining fill dirt on the property Ã’is going to go. ThereÃ•s no doubt about it,Ã“ said Billy Fabec, who lives below the property, perched on a steep ridge just north of the city limits. But Michael Frue, chief county staff attorney, says the county has already Ã’gone above and beyondÃ“ and has no obligation to do more. Ã’This is a private road. ItÃ•s a private community. ItÃ•s very steep terrain,Ã“ Frue said. Ã’ThereÃ•s other developments with similar terrain in the county. I think it comes down to whose responsibility is it to maintain a failing slope.Ã“ Landslides have caused damage to homes and roads across Western North Carolina in recent years as construction has climbed ridges and mountainsides to satisfy homebuyersÃ• desire for long-range views and seclusion. Some residents of The Forest subdivision, where the home in question was located, have wonderful views of the Beaverdam Valley and mountains beyond. The homesite where the slide occurred in July is roughly 550 feet higher than the valley floor despite being only about 3,000 away from Beaverdam Road as the crow flies. A Florida contractor used the home as a second residence. He bought the house and its 1.3-acre lot for $432,400 in 2005, according to property records. County government values most homes around the lot at between $270,000 and $500,000. Firefighters warned some subdivision residents they should evacuate their homes after heavy rain in early July saturated soil under the house and it started moving downhill. The homeÃ•s driveway broke into pieces and sank about 9 or 10 feet below the level of the garage it once led to, neighbors say. The slide exposed part of the underside of the house and sent walls, floors and support posts askew.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-07-04T00:00:00.000","distance":"5.0271600000000003","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.5308,35.6508]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5025","key":"hG7anDmQ4","landslide_size":"Small","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"35.650799999999997","location_accuracy":"Known_within_1_km","longitude":"-82.530799999999999","near":"Woodfin","nearest_places":"145 Black Oak Drive, Asheville, Nc","population":"6123","source_link":"http://www.blackmountainnews.com/article/20131209/NEWS/312090018/County-removes-collapsing-home-neighbors-want-more-work","source_name":"www.blackmountainnews.com","trigger":"Continuous_rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

Spooks Branch Road and an area near the intersection of Skyview Place and Sunset Drive, all in North Asheville, experienced landslides earlier this month due to heavy rains. Both instances resulted in lane or road closures. Assessment of the projectsÃ• scope began as soon as weather and the soil stability on site permitted. Because of the magnitude of their damage, the Skyview and Spooks Branch locations required working with outside contractors. Ã’We initiated an aggressive schedule,Ã“ said Streets and Engineering Services Manager Greg Shuler. During the bank restoration and repair, some road and lane closures are expected. During that time, barricades and markers will be used to indicate road or lane closures. In the interest of public safety, motorists are asked to observe markers and not move or drive around barricades. A section of Spooks Branch Road will be closed for approximately three weeks, with periodic single lane closures over the following few weeks. Skyview Place and Sunset Drive are also currently closed to through traffic. Surrounding residences may also experience occasional water interruptions during construction. See water service interruption information at http://www.ci.asheville.nc.us/Departments/Water/WaterOutages.aspx. Work is expected to be completed at Spooks Branch Road on September 21, and at Skyview Place on October 21.City of Asheville Public Works crews are working to remediate several other landslide sites in the Town Mountain and Beaverdam Valley areas. In all, landslides affected nearly 20 sites in the city. As of Thursday morning, city crews had completed work on eight of those locations. Three landslides that have more extensive damage are currently being evaluated by geotechnical engineers to determine the scope of the repair, and will likely require the assistance of outside contractors. In those three cases, right-of-way and private property issues call for extra due diligence, Shuler said. Ã’It is important to make sure that this is done the right way and that we do things with respect to the property owners,Ã“ Shuler said.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2013-07-04T00:00:00.000","distance":"4.3489699999999996","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.5166,35.6255]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"5026","key":"DJdxnhdc7","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"35.625500000000002","location_accuracy":"Known_within_5_km","longitude":"-82.516599999999997","near":"Asheville","nearest_places":"Town Mountain Area, Asheville, Nc","population":"83393","source_link":"http://www.mountainx.com/article/51561/City-begins-work-to-repair-landslide-damaged-roads","source_name":"www.mountainx.com","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

Now, it's the nearby trees. Officials say a subterranean landslide that closed the Murrysville road to through traffic continues to worsen. Recently, a large tree near the slide toppled over the road, and several others in the area have become unstable. About 130 feet of Twin Oaks Drive between Acorn Lane and Bridgewood Drive began to crumble in early April. Municipal engineer Joe Dietrick said an unstable geological formation, plus the way the road was built, contributed to the problem. Ã’It's definitely not done,Ã“ Dietrick said. Ã’It's going to keep moving until it's happy.Ã“ Dietrick said it would be cost prohibitive to try to restore the road to its preslide condition. Ã’It's so deep that a fix would be astronomical,Ã“ he said. Chief administrator Jim Morrison, who attributed the slide to water washing part of the road away, said the best option for municipal officials is to convert the road into two cul-de-sacs. Officials plan to set aside $200,000 for the project over the next two years but said they don't know how much final repairs and alterations will cost. Dietrick said he hopes that the road Ã‘ which will remain closed between Acorn Lane and Bridgewood Drive Ã‘ will settle enough that work can begin in 2014. Rege Synan, Murrysville Council vice president, said there's no other option but to wait.

The bad news is that the spring has changed direction, and new soil brought in to hold the hillside in place is pulling groundwater from the spring and it is getting heavier and heavier, and the hillside needs corrective action soon or the new fix might become destabilized.  \"The situation has changed,\" Allen told council. Daniel Barnes, engineer on the project, said that perhaps two gallons per minute are coming down the slope. He described two options for stabilizing the situation, and Allen told council cost of the fixes would be $77,000.  Mayor pro tem Butch Berry, sitting in for vacationing Mayor Morris Pate, asked council to vote on an ordinance to waive competitive bidding and approve the funds for the project because it is an emergency. Alderman Lany Ballance suggested it might be worthwhile to get bids and see if there is a better way to fix the problem.  Alderman James DeVito countered that he is concerned that the city has already made a large investment, and he doesn't want to see the city lose that investment by waiting.  \"The earth will not wait for us,\" he pointed out.  Engineer Dee Purkeypile, also familiar with the project, agreed with both Ballance and DeVito. He said that normally, it would be a good idea to get bids, but he pointed out that the contractor, Johnson Landscaping, already has equipment on site and knows what the engineers have in mind.  \"The soil is moving and it will continue to move,\" he said, and he recommended moving forward as quickly as possible.  Alderman Ken Pownall said he felt uncomfortable voting on an ordinance when he wasn't sure Public Works had done its homework.  DeVito answered that three city streets are involved and he felt council would be looking out for the best interests of the city by approving the ordinance.  The ordinance passed 4-2 with Pownall and Ballance voting No.  Lawnmower blues  Cemetery Commission secretary Mary Ann Pownall gave her financial report and made another appeal to council for funds to purchase a new lawnmower to maintain the 40-acre cemetery. Tom Reynolds, who mows the cemetery, told council that the best deal he could find would cost $4,500 plus tax and warranty for a basic heavy-duty mower. The mower is available from a company in Berryville.  \"We really need to get this gentleman the equipment he needs,\" Ballance said. DeVito suggested that they wait until a budget review, but Ballance insisted, \"I don't want to postpone it, postpone it, postpone it! We need to appropriate it now.\"  Alderman Parker Raphael agreed, saying, \"He needs the mower now. He's going to get it, so why wait?\"  Pownall moved to transfer $5,000 from the capital fund to purchase the mower.  DeVito insisted that he wanted to find the money first.  \"They'll get their mower, but we need to do it in an orderly fashion,\" he said. \"In all respect to the Cemetery Commission, I don't think the grass is going to grow that fast in the next couple of weeks.\"  Nevertheless, council voted to instruct City Attorney Tim Weaver to write an ordinance during a brief recess which would make funds available for the mower. When he returned, Weaver told council he was not confident that they were not asking him to write an illegal ordinance, adding that he did not know where the money was coming from or what line item in the budget it would be going to. No one could answer that question and no one from the Finance Department was available, so Weaver cautioned council to think before voting.  Council reconvened Tuesday at 5 p.m., and Berry introduced a resolution which would transfer a total of $5,500 to the Cemetery Commission capital equipment fund for the purchase of the new lawnmower. Pownall moved to approve the resolution and the motion passed 5-0, with DeVito being absent from the special meeting.  Next meeting will be Thursday, August 4, 6 p.m. Â© Copyright 2011 Carroll County News. All rights reserved.

A bus service also is available to take passengers to Silverton, and Harper said he will continue to offer the buses until the trains are running the full route again.  Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad owner Al Harper said the amount of debris and the confined space available to move the debris has caused the delay.  The mud and rock pile, which came down Tuesday afternoon, blocked the tracks about 10 miles south of Silverton. Crews have been working to move the debris, but the narrow canyon the track shares with the Animas River leaves them limited places to put the fallen trees, rock and earth, Harper said.  The railroad still has two trains stuck in Silverton that were unable to make it back to Durango after the slide.

There was a mudslide on Main Street in downtown Ansonia, numerous flooded homes and vehicles on Derbyâ€™s Seymour Avenue and dangerous arcing power lines on Wakelee Avenue. There were no injuries reported. The storm was similar to a freakish storm that damaged Seymour July 8.  This time, however, Seymour was mostly spared, according to officials at Town Hall. This time Mother Nature focused on Ansonia and Derby exclusively.  â€œThis was the worst storm Iâ€™ve seen in Ansonia all my life,â€\u009d said Ansonia Assistant Fire Chief Michael Eheman. â€œI canâ€™t remember hail for the length of time we were getting it. Normally they last five minutes and itâ€™s gone. I would say this had to be a good 15 or 20 minutes.â€\u009d  The rains came down heavy from 6:45 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., said Ron Culmo, Derbyâ€™s public works director.  The fast and heavy rainfall inundated storm drains, causing widespread flash flooding.  The residue of all the flooding made for a massive, all-day clean up job Tuesday.  â€œWeâ€™re cleaning up right now, Seymour Avenue, Hawthorne Avenue, Spring Street, Elizabeth Street â€” the water was like two-feet high in the middle of the road,â€\u009d Culmo said. â€œThere was big flooding by Apollo Pizza and the Dewdrop Inn (off Route 34), because storm drains were not big enough to handle the water at one time,â€\u009d Culmo said.  Wires Down!  Wires and electrical lines arcing were a problem throughout Ansonia and Derby.  In Derby, a tree came down across the entrance of the Sons of Italy Club at 73 High Street, taking live wires with it.  â€œThere were 12 people still inside the parking lot, they couldnâ€™t leave until United Illuminating cleared it out at roughly 11 oâ€™clock,â€\u009d said Derby Assistant Chief Kurt Kemmesies Jr.  â€œThe fire calls were overwhelming last night,â€\u009d said Eileen Krugel, a firefighter for Ansonia who is also grant writer for the city.  Eheman said the fire calls did not slow down until 11 p.m.  A few public buildings also suffered some flood damage, including a leaking roof at the Ansonia Armory, where some ceiling tiles came down, and water seeping through the doors around Ansonia City Hall.  Live wires fell to the ground at the intersection of Wakelee and Hull Street in Ansonia Monday, causing a spectacular display of sparks and flames. Luckily, no one was injured.  The live wires sparked and jumped around, as the Ansonia Fire Department waited for the utility company to cut the power.  Several people were inside the home at the time, but because the wires were close to the front door, they couldnâ€™t safely get out of the house, according to Valley Indy reader, Walt Smith.  Smith happened to be driving through the area after power lines were downed in front of a Wakelee Avenue home.  So he did what any earnest Valley Indy reader would do: He grabbed his video camera, shot some video of the scene and posted it to the Valley Indy Facebook page.  Here is Smithâ€™s video:  The wires were touching a metal fence that ran along the outside of the property, and Ansonia firefighters were trying to communicate with people inside the home.  The people couldnâ€™t come out the front door because thatâ€™s where the live wires were, Smith said. And there didnâ€™t appear to be a back exit from the home, he said.  â€œIt was very well controlled,â€\u009d Smith said. â€œThe Ansonia Fire Department did a great job controlling the crowd and managing people.â€\u009d  No one was home at the house Tuesday morning, and phone messages were left with the homeâ€™s owner.  Smith admitted Tuesday he might have gotten a little too close to the wires â€” which were flaming and sparking in the front yard of the two-family home. You can see toward the end of the video, a firefighter asks him to move away from the scene.  â€œIâ€™m the first to admit, I was foolish for getting as close as I did to get that video,â€\u009d Smith said. â€œBut I knew not to step in the puddles of water.â€\u009d  Two Restaurants Knocked Offline  Burger King, on Pershing Drive in Ansonia, got walloped by the heavy rain fall.  A portion of the roof over the drive-through section of the restaurant suffered damage about 8:15 p.m. There was some five inches of water on the building itself, which seeped into the restaurant, causing ceiling tiles inside to collapse.  Workers at the scene Tuesday morning were mopping up water from the floors, saying they did not know when the restaurant would reopen.  The nearby McDonaldâ€™s restaurant, on Division Street in Derby, also got whacked.  The entire Division Street area was flooded with about 4.5 feet of water at about 7:30 p.m., according to firefighters.  McDonaldâ€™s manager Nancy Contreras said the restaurant had to close between 9 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. to clean up flooding in the customer lobby.  â€œThe water was this deep,â€\u009d she said, showing a depth of several inches with her finger gestures.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2011-08-01T00:00:00.000","distance":"0.17013","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.299,41.7497]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"3870","key":"SGarJtmK4","landslide_size":"Small","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"41.749699999999997","location_accuracy":"Known_within_50_km","longitude":"-77.299000000000007","near":"Wellsboro","nearest_places":"Main Street in downtown Ansonia","population":"3263","source_link":"http://valley.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/ansonia_and_derby_deal_with_storm_damage","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

County Roads 320 (the Rifle-Rulison Road), 115 (Red Canyon Road) and 100 (Catherine Store Road) in Missouri Heights were closed in late July as a result of mudslides and rockfalls along certain stretches.  Public Works Director Betsy Suerth got permission on Monday from the Garfield Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) to spent an estimated $2 million to fix the roads, and to do so in an â€œexpedited mannerâ€\u009d to get the roads open to the public as quickly as possible.  â€œI believe that the damages have caused unsafe conditions and pose a threat to the safety of the public,â€\u009d Suerth told the BOCC.  County attorney Andrew Gorgey assured the BOCC that state law does allow for such shortcuts in the case of emergencies.  That means the county's normal procurement system, in particular the advertisement for requests for proposals from interested contractors, will be skipped.  In fact, one contract, for $459,548 to fix the Rifle-Rulison Road, was awarded on Monday to the Con-Sy Inc. company of Rifle.  Con-Sy was the low bidder in a list of three firms, which included Frontier Paving and Aspen Earth Moving.  Commissioner Mike Samson, agreeing with the other two commissioners that â€œwe definitely have to do something,â€\u009d balked at spending $2 million so quickly.  â€œIs there another approach to this?â€\u009d he asked.  Although the contract for one road already has been awarded, Garfield County procurement officer Jim Hackett said it will be another 10 days before the same could be done for the other two roads.  In the meantime, Commissioner John Martin suggested that the need to fix Red Canyon Road, in particular, should be examined.  â€œThat has been deemed an argument since the creation of 115 Road itself,â€\u009d he remarked. â€œDoes it really need to be open, because it's such a dangerous road.â€\u009d  Garfield County officials have debated the subject for years, bickering about the narrow road enclosed by steep canyon walls that, on one side, form a sheer drop to the floor far below. In winter, the steep canyon walls allows in little sun to melt accumulated snow and ice, making the road even more treacherous.  County Manager Ed Green said the county could look at rebuilding Red Canyon Road to make it safer, a project he predicted could cost as much a $28 million.  No decisions were made other than a unanimous vote to award the Rifle-Rulison Road project to Con-Sy, for $459,548. With other costs not included in the contract, the project is to cost up to $650,000.  jcolson@postindependent.com ","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2011-07-30T00:00:00.000","distance":"1.1164700000000001","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.7776,39.5256]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"3867","key":"DJn_h9mQW","landslide_size":"Small","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"39.525599999999997","location_accuracy":"Known_within_10_km","longitude":"-107.77760000000001","near":"Rifle","nearest_places":"Rifle-Rulison Road, Garfield County, CO","population":"9172","source_link":"http://www.postindependent.com/article/20110808/VALLEYNEWS/110809897/1083&ParentProfile=1074","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

The Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) accepted bids for the project Monday and expected work to begin by Wednesday or Thursday, said Mike Hermes, trails and facilities manager. The trail was covered by 15 slides in a 1.5-mile stretch when more than 2 inches of rain fell in an hour in the late-afternoon cloudburst last month. Three of the slides were major, with one dumping boulders, rocks and mud up to 25 feet on the trail. Another dozen were â€œnuisance slidesâ€\u009d that RFTA deals with regularly, Hermes said.  The trail between Rock Bottom Ranch and Catherine Bridge has been closed since the slides. Through traffic on the popular trail has been sent on a detour that involves Willits Lane, Valley Road, old Highway 82 and Catherine Road. The detour routes riders around a 3.5-mile stretch of the trail.  Hermes said RFTA has fielded numerous telephone calls inquiring when the trail will open again.  At this point, it doesn't appear that major sections of the trail must be rebuilt. â€œMost of the trail appears to be intact,â€\u009d Hermes said. The asphalt on a section he estimated to be 30 feet long was damaged and will be opened this year with road base, a crushed type of gravel. A longer-term solution will be undertaken at a later date.  â€œI just want to get it open as soon as I can,â€\u009d Hermes said.  Closer to Aspen, Pitkin County Open Space and Trails is clearing mudslide debris from a stretch between Stein Park and McLain Flats Road. The trail is open and passable, but cyclists and pedestrians should be aware of equipment.

A massive mudslide closed down Highway 145 just west of Telluride for eight hours on Monday night and into Tuesday morning, and another closed the only road into Ophir. And an apparent lightning strike knocked out the Mill Creek Water Treatment Plant Monday night, shutting it down and putting the town on its backup system.  â€œThe plant is currently not operating and we are awaiting a new power supply which will be shipped overnight. As we will be operating exclusively on our back up system (Stillwell) for the next couple days, it could be a challenge to meet water demand,â€\u009d wrote Town Manager Greg Clifton in a memo Tuesday. â€œThe Town would like to ask its citizens and visitors to please conserve water while we make the necessary repairs.  Outdoor irrigation, as one example, could likely be curtailed for a temporary time frame considering the monsoonal weather patterns.â€\u009d  When the summer monsoons pound down with such ferocity as Monday, the water becomes too much for the hillsides to handle, resulting in mudslides on steep slopes. The backup treatment system, Stillwell, has about three-quarters the storage and treatment potential of the Mill Creek facility, which can treat about 750,000 gallons per day and store up to one million. According to Clifton, the town of Telluride can exceed a million gallons of water use on a busy and hot summer day.  The town is awaiting a new power supply for the plant and is encouraging water users to make due with less â€” no outdoor irrigation, for example.  â€œWeâ€™re definitely going into a water conservation mode,â€\u009d said Mayor Stu Fraser. â€œJust cut back as much as you can in any way that you can.â€\u009d  MUDSLIDE CLOSES ROAD  The mudslide ran across the highway near the Illium Road turnoff, with the most severe mud coming east of Deep Creek Road. Colorado Department of Transportation crews and San Miguel County Sheriffâ€™s deputies worked from 6:30 p.m. on Monday to just after 3 a.m. Tuesday morning to clear the roads.  No one was hurt in the slides, according to the San Miguel County Sheriffâ€™s Office. Todd Jones, of CDOT, said crews moved 800 square yards of debris from the highway.  Traffic was stopped at Keystone Hill and drivers were advised to drive around the Telluride Regional Airport to Last Dollar Road. There were mudslides on the alternate routes as well according to reports, though they were smaller.  â€œAs long as the weatherâ€™s still good and itâ€™s not raining heavily, thatâ€™s the preferred detour,â€\u009d said Jennifer Dinsmore, the public relations officer with the sheriffâ€™s office.  The sheriffâ€™s office encourages drivers to pack a kit with food, water and warm clothes or a sleeping bag in the event they get stuck.  â€œKnow your alternate routes,â€\u009d Dinsmore said, adding that thereâ€™s no stock advice for mudslides because sometimes itâ€™s dangerous to either stay in oneâ€™s car or flee. â€œYou just have to use your best judgment,â€\u009d she said.  The storms were expected to taper off later this week.

Torrential downpours hammered Oaxaca, causing mudslides that blocked roads and destroyed homes.  In the seaport of Salina Cruz, one mudslide killed two people when it buried their house.  \"The excess of water, the mudslide, is what brought the house down and two people inside were buried,\" said local police chief, Rolando Soriano.  The local media reported that three other people had been injured in a separate mudslide.  Troops and Red Cross teams brought hot food and other basic supplies to Salina Cruz residents while the Oaxacan state government recommended that the federal government declare a state of emergency in several parts of the department.  Forecasters expect the rain to continue for at least another day.   Bookmark and Share  Blog   Forum Give Comments      ~~~~Oaxaca â€“  At least three people died and more than 180,000 others were affected by the torrential rains that hit southern Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec over the weekend, officials in Oaxaca state said.  Two people died in Salina Cruz, a city southeast of Oaxaca city, the state capital, and one person died in San Jose Chiltepec, north of the capital, Gov. Gabino Cue said.  Gabriel Lopez Estudillo, 82, and his daughter, Sandra Luz Lopez Luca, 34, died when a mudslide buried their house in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region.  A woman died when she was swept away early Sunday by a river in San Jose Chiltepec, a city in the Papaloapan Basin region near the border with Veracruz state.  Emergency management officials plan to survey families affected by the rains to determine their needs once the clean-up is completed, Cue said.  An emergency declaration was requested on Sunday for 42 of Oaxaca's 570 municipalities so federal reconstruction assistance can be obtained, state government secretary-general Irma PiÃ±eyro Arias said.  The torrential rains \"have caused damage to dwellings and the main access routes to areas affected by the storm,\" PiÃ±eyro Arias said.  Army troops activated an emergency plan to assist residents of cities in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the area most affected by the heavy rains from a tropical wave.  Health Secretariat teams have fanned out across the region, providing medical care and disease prevention services to residents affected by flooding in Salina Cruz, Tehuantepec and neighboring cities, such as San Mateo del Mar, San Pedro Huamelula and Santiago Astata, among others, officials said.  Oaxaca Infrastructure Secretariat and water commission personnel are moving heavy equipment and trucks into affected areas as part of the clean-up operation.  A mudslide blocked the Istmo-Huatulco highway in the city of Salina Cruz, making it difficult to access the area.  Several rivers and streams have overflowed their banks in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region, with water levels reaching 1.5 meters (nearly five feet) in some places.

But the town and the valley will be able to pull clean drinking water from the high Lasky Gulch for at least a few months while waiting for the sediment from the slide to clear.  â€œThe immediate concern was the question: Was it a large enough slide to where it could deposit enough material to create a blockage on Straight Creek?â€\u009d Dillon town manager Devin Granbery said. â€œThere would be a potential for the build up of water behind a blockage and then a release. and there was a potential for damage to property and life safety issues there.â€\u009d  A release of water from a behind a landslide dam could also damage the Dillon and Dillon Valley diversion plants downstream, which pull water from the creek to be filtered for drinking water.  Fortunately, the slide did not create a blockage, according to Forest Service hydrology experts.  The town will pull drinking water primarily from Lasky Gulch because the sediment still in the creek from the slide can be damaging to the diversion plants.  The town has also left an excavator off Interstate 70 near the site of the slide, which will be able to remove a blockage quickly if the slide moves farther into the creek.  â€œWe feel pretty confident at this point that there's no immediate threat to life or property,â€\u009d Granbery said.  But the towns of Silverthorne and Dillon both have to confront the long-term impacts of the heavy sediment spilled into the water, which, once the creek feeds into the Blue River, could eventually threaten Silverthorne's fisheries.  It is unclear what caused the slide. Granbery said it might have been the rain and moisture in recent weeks, erosion from the beetle kill, a slackening of the soil as the ground thawed or a combination of factors.  Dillon is working with the county, Silverthorne, the Colorado Department of Transportation and the Forest Service as well as local utility companies to ensure power lines and other infrastructure in the area aren't damaged and to begin to find ways to deal with the long-term problems posed by the sediment.  â€œWe have to be working with all those agencies involved to see what are the long-term impacts of the landslide,â€\u009d Granbery said. â€œWe may be piping sedimentation ponds to help us with long-term treatment of water. Eventually it will revegetate itself.

However, a new slide developed in the westbound lane resulting in the detours.â€\u009d Holwell said that in response to the slides, WYDOT closed I-90 between Buffalo and Sheridan for westbound traveling truck traffic, detouring travel on US Highway 16 to Ucross then US 14 back to Sheridan.  As of press time, passenger vehicle travel was still being detoured around the slide from the Meade Creek Exit into Sheridan.  All Eastbound traffic remains on I-90, however, traffic lanes have been narrowed and speeds will be reduced.   â€œWe will be able to get westbound traffic into the eastbound lane pretty soon,â€\u009d Holwell said. â€œBut itâ€™s going to take quite awhile to get the westbound lane open again.

Between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m., five slides covered the area where state Route 92 and state Route 144 connect. The area is also known as where American Fork Canyon road intersects with the Alpine Loop Scenic Byway. The slides, which covered the roads with mud, rocks and debris, were triggered by strong thunderstorms.  Scott Thompson with the Utah Department of Transportation said the canyon received about 2 inches of rain Tuesday night, which was too much for the already-saturated hillsides. UDOT crews had been expecting slides in the canyon because they happen every year, but five slides in one night was unusual.  UDOT crews were able to clear enough mud off one lane to get stranded campers and bikers down the canyon, said UDOT spokesman Nile Easton.  Some motorists were reportedly stranded at Tibble Fork for several hours.  But to get the heavy portions of debris off the road, bulldozers and heavy equipment were used to scoop mud -- which was 7 feet deep and 200 feet wide in some spots -- off the road, he said.

Citiparks director Mike Radley said the pool could reopen as soon as Friday. The facility has been closed since heavy weekend rainfall triggered the mudslide about 7:30 p.m. Monday. Muddy water rushed down a hill next to the Magee Community Center and through a chain-link fence around the park's perimeter, Mr. Radley said.  The mudslide didn't knock down any trees or cause any serious damage to the community center, Mr. Radley said, but it left \"a good bit of brush, dirt and debris\" behind.  While Magee Community Center staff and employees from the Citiparks aquatics division and the Department of Public Works have succeeded in clearing out Magee's park, the swimming pool has required more work.  \"Draining the pool was necessary,\" Mr. Radley said. \"We have to clean the pool shell, hose down the pool and get it ready for fresh water.\"  Once the pool is refilled, the water must be fully sanitized and chlorinated.  Except for a few inches of murky brown water in the deep end, the pool was empty Wednesday afternoon. A woman was scrubbing the pool with a hose and push broom.  The pool, which has a capacity of 476 swimmers, is usually well-attended in the summer, Mr. Radley said.  Sam Rothaus, who lives just minutes away from the Magee pool on nearby McCaslin Street, also said the pool is regularly packed with \"kids of all age groups.\" She walked to the community center with her swimsuit-clad son Elijah, 8, and daughter Sadie, 6, Wednesday afternoon, only to find the pool empty and the community center deserted.  \"We just went down there and they're cleaning it, so we couldn't go down there,\" Sadie said, holding a large beach towel.  Since the closure, lifeguards have had to relocate regularly scheduled swim classes as well as the swim team that practices at Magee pool. Still, Mr. Radley said he hadn't heard of increased crowds at other city pools.

The Cincinnati Enquirer reports Sunday that the Ohio Emergency Management Agency estimates the county has $7.4 million in damage. Statewide, the estimate is at $43 million.  The damage comes in the wake of 24.78 inches of rain that fell on Cincinnati during the meteorological spring months of March, April and May, a National Weather Service record in data going back to 1871.  County Engineer William Brayshaw has asked commissioners to fund temporary road fixes nearly every week, up from no such requests the past two years.  The county, along with neighboring Clermont County, have joined 19 Ohio counties to ask for Federal Emergency Management Agency declaration as a major disaster, a move that would allow the counties to receive federal aid for repairs.  In the Cincinnati region, including northern Kentucky, 41.04 inches of rain have fallen since the start of the year, twice the amount that had fallen over the same time period in 2010 and slightly more than the average 12-month rainfall, according to the National Weather Service.  â€œItâ€™s possible weâ€™ll exceed the all-time wettest year on record,â€\u009d said Don Hughes, a meteorologist technician with the National Weather Service in Wilmington.  Part of an infrastructure tax, prompted by a 1986-87 business study, nets about $700,000 a year in Cincinnati and has helped fund a program that works to stabilize against landslides, The Enquirer reports.  Since the program started, the city has stabilized more than 60 locations, said Rich Pohana, Cincinnatiâ€™s geotechnical engineer.  â€œIf those slides were not stabilized this would have been much more dramatic,â€\u009d he said.  Officials said heavy rain in 1996 also brought significant damage to the area. Road damage and landslides cost Hamilton County taxpayers $2.3 million that year, according to the Hamilton County engineerâ€™s office.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2011-07-03T00:00:00.000","distance":"3.7707600000000001","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.7316,38.9941]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"3719","key":"D5Hyt5Fc7","landslide_size":"Large","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"38.994100000000003","location_accuracy":"Known_within_15_km","longitude":"-84.7316","near":"Burlington","nearest_places":"Boone county, KY","population":"15926","source_link":"http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/briefs/x1766047308/Cincinnati-wet-weather-means-costly-road-damage","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

The most outstanding feature of this so-called Bolivarian revolution has been the lack of investment in development plans in any of the areas that are vital to the country. As a consequence, PDVSA, the national electricity system, the public transportation system, the potable water system, the sewage system, and garbage collection (or lack of it) are all showing serious signs of deterioration, this being the hallmark of ChÃ¡vezâ€™s style of government. Much less has there been any urban planning that takes into account the public services that will be required as a result of natural population growth.  Another area that reflects the failure of the â€œrevolutionâ€™sâ€\u009d government is the countryâ€™s infrastructure, particularly the roads. Here the Bolivarians have not hit on ways to maintain existing infrastructure or to invest in the building of new roads. It is no longer just that it let the Caracas-La Guaira Viaduct collapse or that it failed to find a lasting solution to the problem of La Cabrera Tunnel or that it turned a deaf ear to warnings by experts of the risks posed by the bridges over the Orinoco River and Lake Maracaibo. Now people all around the country are suffering the consequences of the governmentâ€™s ineptitude, finding themselves penned in because urban and interurban roads are full of potholes, blocked by landslides or have partly disappeared after huge chunks have fallen into the abyss. Some weeks ago, the national press reported that MÃ©rida was completely cut off owing to landslides on the road that connects it to Barinitas and Barinas. Another landslide kept the stretch of the Charallave National Highway that links it up with the Central Regional Highway closed between July 3 and July 9, complicating things for traffic going to Maracay and Valencia.  Last week, part of the Valle-Coche Freeway, in the area of Fuerte Tiuna, collapsed owing to a mega hole -more than 2 meters deep and two lanes wide- caused by a burst water pipe (for which Hidrocapital is responsible).  Now people are warning of the risk the Pan-American Highway (Los Teques-Caracas) is running of collapsing owing to a huge hole at Km 25, which started to appear a year ago and has already eaten away two lanes.  In its eagerness to expropriate and plunder the property of private businesses, the government has neglected what should be its main concern: the well-being of the citizens and the development of the country by setting it on the path to prosperity.","continentcode":"SA","country":"Venezuela","countrycode":"VE","countryname":"Venezuela","date":"2011-07-03T00:00:00.000","distance":"19.81345","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.7016,8.6815]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"3723","key":"SGMvRPFc7","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Landslide","latitude":"8.6814999999999998","location_accuracy":"Known_within_50_km","longitude":"-70.701599999999999","near":"Santo Domingo","nearest_places":"MÃ©rida","population":"0","source_link":"http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=406529&CategoryId=13303","trigger":"Rain","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

The road has been closed since then, causing a traffic nightmare for hundreds of homeowners, who call the street a main artery through the township, Miele reported.  The road also borders Route 66 and is often used as a shortcut for motorists who want to avoid the toll road.

(WSAZ) -- Hundreds of families awakened to no power. One woman had no backyard -- all thanks to a big landslide.

But, Keith wasn't the only one affected. Along with her yard, her trees and her fence went -- downed power lines knocking out electricity to hundreds of homes on Huntington's Southside.  While Keith owns the top part of the hill, Cabell Huntington Hospital owns the bottom two-thirds. Cleaning up the mess truly will be a team effort.  â€œWe have fallen victim to the heavy rainfall that has plagued many other places,\" said Charles Shumaker, a spokesperson for Cabell Huntington Hospital. \"We have engineers looking at the hillside today, and we want to work with our neighbors to find a fix for this.\"  A couple dozen mudslides have been reported throughout the city in recent days, including one that slipped overnight along Enslow Boulevard next to Ritter Park.

According to media reports, the landslide took place 15 miles south of Bucaramanga and has disconnected Bogota to Bucaramanga, Cucuta and forces travelers to the Caribbean city of Barranquilla to take a large detour.  The landslide reportedly did not only destroy the bridge, but also a police post and swept away a motorbike and a car. Media reports are contradictory about injuries. According to newspaper El Espectador no injures were reported, while Caracol Radio reported 15 people were injured.  Construction workers were sent to the scene to reopen the highway.  The Bucaramanga - Bogota highway is the second to be destroyed by a landslide this week. On Monday, Bucaramanga was cut off with the city of Barrancabermeja and Medellin because of another landslide.  The landslides are caused by torrential rains that have hit Colombia almost non-stop since the first quarter of last year.

Leaving branches and debris blocking whatâ€™s left of the road.  -----  Since Tuesday morning, crews have surveyed seven mudslides, mostly along 420. Another one on Big Eddy Rd. closed that roadway and washed part of it away into the Kentucky River.  \"Big Eddy Road will be closed indefinitely until we believe it is safe to return and begin the rebuilding process,\" said Slone.  -----  On nearby Big Eddy Road, the rain not only brought down the mud, it also washed away the earth under the road. Crews can't even approach the mudslide because the road may not be strong enough to hold their equipment.  The earth around the mudslide is so wet, water is still pouring out of it. Crews hope the rain holds off long enough to finish this work.   ------  KY 420 is expected to be reopened by this weekend. But a larger slide on KY 1263 or Big Eddy Road on the river may take much longer.  \"Maybe a few weeks before the whole stretch is completely open,\" says Sloan.  The swollen KY River is not the only reason this road collapsed. A major mud slide caused what was left of the road to fall down to the bank.  Bob Lewis has lived by the KY River for more than 40 years and says the water didn't get that high it was enough to take the sediment from under the road.  \"The rains have complicated it because it's coming down the hill and washing underneath the road and it's making it worse. I've never seen this amount of rain in that amount of time,\" says Lewis.","continentcode":"NA","country":"United States","countrycode":"US","countryname":"United States","date":"2011-05-03T00:00:00.000","distance":"3.6175700000000002","fatalities":"0","geolocation":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.8703,38.1684]},"hazard_type":"landslide","id":"3456","key":"D9RYt5dB4","landslide_size":"Medium","landslide_type":"Mudslide","latitude":"38.168399999999998","location_accuracy":"Known_within_1_km","longitude":"-84.8703","near":"Frankfort","nearest_places":"Big Eddy rd(Highway 1263) by river, Franklin county, KY","population":"25527","source_link":"http://www.wtvq.com/iphone/8143-franklin-county-mudslide-cleanup","time":"Morning","trigger":"Downpour","tstamp":"Tue Apr 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)","version":"1"}

A pickup truck and a cargo truck were buried and rescue teams recovered four bodies from the vehicles and that of another passerby who was walking along the street there at the time of the landslide.  Germanico Pinto, with the municipal Public Works department, said that the mudslide resulted from the water runoff from the neighborhoods that have been established on the higher parts of the hillsides near the road.

Highway engineers say damage to KY 93 between the 8 and 9 mile marker south of Eddyville is so serious the project is more about rebuilding the roadway rather than repairing it.  The heavy rain that lead to near-record flooding across the region saturated the soil causing the roadway to drop as much as 10 feet along about a 1500-foot section of highway in the Eddy Creek area.  Early estimates indicate the cost of repair will be about $600,000.  This week, a contractor that specializes in landslide repair has drilled and placed steel posts into the slide area to help stabilize the soil.  Starting Monday the crew will drive pilings along the lower edge of the slide to further stabilize the area.  Once a retaining wall is constructed, the area will be back filled and compacted to help reduce the possibility of future slides developing at the site.  Engineers say the highway may be closed until July while the work is completed.  KY 93 is a popular route for tourists coming to Lake Barkley. It runs through southern Lyon County and serves a number of resorts and marinas.  The closure adds about 12 miles to a trip between Eddyville and Eddy Creek.  -----  The highway south of Eddyville near Eddy Bay has been shut down since April 25 after what state officials term a â€œmajor landslideâ€\u009d affected the road suface.  â€¦ The roadâ€™s surface dropped by as much as 10 feet along a 1,500-foot section of the highway after heavy rain saturated the soil along a fill area.

Damage to farms like Garcia's from months of heavy rains in Colombia, the world's No. 1 producer of top-quality washed arabica beans, may threaten to push coffee prices even higher.  Colombia harvests coffee yearround and landslides blocking roads are complicating exports of already-picked beans, while downpours expected to continue for at least another month could knock ripe coffee cherries off trees and rot them in the fields.  Garcia estimates he lost 40 per cent of his crop, which he sells to gourmet roasters such as Italy's premium coffee brand Illycaffe.  \"It sounded like the world was ending,\" Garcia, 54, said of the mountainside collapse near his cinder block house in the lush municipality called Tena, several hours from the capital.

Downpours caused by the La Nina weather phenomenon have killed hundreds of people across Colombia and forced more than 2 million from their homes in what the government calls the worst natural disaster in the country's history.  Relief workers said a landslide smacked into a bus outside the city of Manizales, the capital of the coffee-producing Caldas department, late on Wednesday.  Twelve bodies have been recovered so far and eight are trapped under the rock and mud, they said.  -----  Rescue workers have recovered the bodies of 15 passengers from a bus accident on the route from Manizales to Bogota, with at least three still unaccounted for, W Radio reported Thursday.  The bodies were found along the length of the Chinchina River.  Authorities informed W Radio that they have given up hope of finding any survivors from the bus that was carrying at least 18 passengers when it was swept over the edge of a cliff by a landslide caused by excessive heavy rains.  Other news sources, including El Espectador, currently place the number of bodies found at 14, while the total number of passengers may be as high as 20.  -----  The bus, which was travelling from Bogota to Manizales, was seemingly forced off the road near and into a gorge in the area of El Diamante, where bad weather continued to hinder the rescue efforts.  \"According to locals of the region there were two landslides.

A wall of mud rolled off the top of Buck Mountain in Maggie Valley on Feb. 5, sliding 3,000 feet and cutting Rich Cove Road in two places. The slide cut off access to 37 homes and damaged at least four.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Emergency Watershed Protection program is spending $1.3 million there along with a state and local match of about $300,000 to fix the top of the mountain.  The slide happened after a system of retaining walls failed at Ghost Town in the Sky, an amusement park that is in bankruptcy. Maggie Valley will be responsible for hiring an engineer to do the work.  Betty Miner, whose home suffered broken windows and gutters but no serious damage during the slide, said Friday that crews are still working on building a road to the start of the slide.  Once the road is complete, an engineer will develop a repair plan. For now, Miner and her neighbors are living elsewhere because the mountain is still not safe.  Miner's glad for the pause in the rain. The unstable material above Rich Cove, about 16,000 tons, is more than the amount that came down last month.

There was also large piles of mud and debris that had been moved to the side of the road, where hours earlier there had been a landslide.
